## TV Show/Movie Analysis Dashboard using Plotly-dash

I built this dashboard to visualize insights about my favorite shows/movies.

### Walkthrough:
- **Web Scraping** - using BeautifulSoup to scrape websites and build datasets
- **Natural Language Processing** - for sentiment analysis and more
- **Dashboard** - using plotly-dash to visualize all of the info 

### Steps to run:
- Run **web_scraping.py** to build datasets of all the dialogue exchanges of your favorite TV show/movie
- (if using my datasets) copy the datasets from the datasets folder to the folder with web_scraping.py and final_code.py
- Run **final_code.py** to implement NLP and build a dashboard
