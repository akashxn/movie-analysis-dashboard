Mr. Potato Head, Here’s your arm.
Mrs. Potato Head, Give me that. That’s mine.
Mr. Potato Head," Honey, the mustache?"
Buzz, I don’t quite recall playtime being quite that strenuous.
Rex, Andy never played with us like that.
Jessie, We’re just gonna have to make the best of it.
Mr. Potato Head," But these toddlers, they don’t know how to play with us."
Rex, They’re too young!
Hamm," Yeah, they’re sticky."
Slinky," Well, we should be in the Butterfly Room."
Mrs. Potato Head, OFFSCREEN With the big kids!
Mr. Potato Head, OFFSCREEN That’s right.
Hamm," Yeah, you said it."
Buzz, We’ll get this straightened out. I’ll go talk to Lotso about moving us to the other room. Blast. Try that one.
Jessie, It’s locked!
Slinky, Same here.
Buzz, Try the windows.
Hamm, Negatory. It’s a Fenster-Schneckler 380. Finest childproof lock in the world.
Mrs. Potato Head, We’re trapped!
Buzz, Wait. Did anyone notice the transom?
Mr. Potato Head," Oh, great. How do we get up there?"
Buzz," All right, everyone. On three! One, two…"

Stretch," Oh, please! Landfill!"
Ken, Cowgirl? Dinosaur?
Twitch, Toddler fodder.
Ken," But that space guy, he could be useful."
Chunk, He ain’t the sharpest kinfe in the the place where they keep the knives.
Sparks," OFFSCREEN Neither are you, Chunk."
Twitch," You got a little keeper yourself, didn’t you, Ken?"
Ken," Hey, lay off, Twitch. Barbie’s different."
Stretch," Aw, Mr. Softy over here."
Chunk, What do expect from a girl’s toy?
Ken, I’m not a girl’s toy! I’m not! Why do you guys keep saying that?
Twitch," Ah, all them toys are disposable. We’ll be lucky if they last us a week."
Ken," Well, well. Looky who we have here."
Buzz, Let me go!
Ken, Take him to the library.
Buzz, No!
Woody, QUIETLY 1225 Sycamore.
Mr. Pricklepants," Psst. Woody, what are you doing?"
Woody, I gotta get outta here.
Trixie, You’re leaving?
Buttercup, But didn’t you have fun today?
Woody," Well, of course I did, more than I’ve had in years, but, you see, I belong to someone else."
Buttercup," Who’s ""Yid-nuh""?"
Mr. Pricklepants," I believe it’s pronounced ""Yid-nay."""
Dolly," Guys, it says ""Andy."""
Woody, He’s my Bonnie. And he’s leaving soon. I gotta get home.
Peas-in-A-Pod, Where’s home?

Dolly," We’re on it, cowboy. Trixie?"
Trixie, I’ll fire up the computer.
Buzz," GRUNTING Unhand me, you cowards! I demand to talk to Lotso!"
Ken," Zip it, Buck Rogers. You don’t talk to Lotso till we say you can…"
Lotso, Ken? What’s goin’ on here? Why is this toy tied up?
Ken," STAMMERS He got out, Lotso."
Lotso," ""Got out""? Oh, no, no, no, no, no. This isn’t how we treat our guests. F-A-Oh, my Schwarz. There you go. I’m so sorry."
Buzz," Lotso, there’s been a mistake."
Lotso, A mistake?
Buzz, The children in the Caterpillar Room are not age-appropriate for me and my friends. We respectfully request a transfer to the Butterfly Room.
Lotso," Well, request granted!"
Ken," But, Lotso…"
Lotso," Hush now, Kenneth. This toy’s shown initiative, leadership. Why, I’d say we’ve found ourselves a keeper. Hear that, everyone? We got a keeper!"
Lotso," We’re calling you up to the big leagues, son. From now on, you’ll have anything you want."
Buzz, Excellent. I’ll go get my friends.
Lotso," Whoa, whoa. Hold on there, boss. Those Caterpillar kids need someone to play with."
Buzz, But my friends don’t belong there.
Lotso," Oh, none of us do, I agree. Which is why, for the good of our community, we ask the never toys, the stronger ones, to take on the hardships the rest of us can’t bear anymore."
Buzz," Well, I-I guess that makes sense. But I can’t accept. We’re a family. We stay together."
Lotso," Family man, huh? I understand. Put him back in the timeout chair."
Buzz, OFFSCREEN What are ya… Unhand me!
Lotso, Bring in the Bookworm.
Ken, WHISTLES

Buzz, No!
Lotso," ""…slide the switch from Play to Demo."""
Buzz, OFFSCREEN Stop! No! No! NOOOOO!!!!!
Jessie, GASPS What was that?
Hamm, Sounds like it came from the hall.
Mrs. Potato Head, I’ll see what it was.
Jessie, OFFSCREEN What do you see? Anything?
Mrs. Potato Head," OFFSCREEN No, just a dark hallway and… GASPS Wait. Wait! I see Andy!"
Jessie, What?
Mr. Potato Head, That’s impossible.
Mrs. Potato Head," No, no, I really see him. In his room. GASPS My other eye! The one I left behind. This is so weird. He’s packing up. Uh-oh. Oh, here comes Buster. Out of the way! Get away! Okay, Andy’s out in the hall. He’s looking in the attic. Wait, there’s Mom. Why is he so upset? Oh, no! Oh, this is terrible! He’s looking for us. Andy’s looking for us!"
Jessie, He’s looking for us?
Rex, So Andy does want us. I knew it! I just knew it!
Mrs. Potato Head, I think he did mean to put us in the attic.
Slinky," Well, then, Woody was telling the truth."
Mr. Potato Head, Holy cow!
Hamm, And you didn’t believe him.
Mr. Potato Head," Hey, you didn’t believe him first!"
Jessie," Guys, we gotta… We gotta go home! Lotso!"
Lotso," Hey, there. How y’all doin’ this fine evenin’?"
Jessie, SIGHS Thank goodness! Have you seen Buzz?
Mrs. Potato Head, There’s been a mistake. We have to go.
Lotso," Go? Why, you just got here. In the nick of time, too. We were runnin’ low on volunteers for the little ones. They just love new toys, now, don’t they?"
Mr. Potato Head," ""Love""? We’ve been chewed, kicked, drooled on."
Mrs. Potato Head, Just look at my pocketbook!
Lotso," Hmm. Well, here’s the thing, sweet potato. You ain’t leavin’ Sunnyside."
Mrs. Potato Head," ""Sweet potato""!? Who do you think you’re talking to?! I have over 30 accessories, and I deserve more respect--!"
Lotso, Ah… That’s better.
Mr. Potato Head," Hey, no one takes my wife’s mouth, except me. Give it back, you furry air freshener!"
Jessie," Come on, guys. We’re goin’ home."
Lotso," Whoa there, missy. You’re not goin’ anywhere."
Jessie," Oh, yeah? And who’s gonna stop us?"
Rex, Buzz! You’re back!
Buzz, Hoo-yah!
Rex, OFFSCREEN Buzz?
Jessie, Hey!
Hamm," OFFSCREEN Look out! What are you, nuts?"
Slinky, Buzz!
Buzz," Prisoners disabled, Commander Lotso!"
Jessie," Buzz, what are you doing?"
Buzz," Silence, millions of Zurg! You’re the custody of the Galatic Alliance!"
Rex," ""Zurg""?"
Mr. Potato Head," ""Galatic Alliance""?"
Hamm," Oh, boy."
Lotso," Good work, Lightyear. Now, lock ‘em up!"
Buzz," Yes, sir!"
Rex, SHRIEKS
Jessie, EXCLAIMING
Chunk, Ow!
Stretch, Where do you think you’re going?
Jessie, Buzz! We’re your friends!
Buzz," Spare me your lies, temptress. Your emperor’s defeated, and I’m immune to your bewitching good looks."
Mr. Potato Head," Hey, Mongo! Keep your paws off my wife! Hey! Let go of me, you drooling doofus!"
Lotso, Not him. I think this potato needs to learn himself some manners. Take him to the box.
Mr. Potato Head," Hey! Put me down, you moron! Where are you taking me? Bad baby! Bad baby!"
Barbie, Ken? What’s going on?
Ken, Barbie! I told you to wait in the Dream House.
Barbie, What are you doing to my friends?
Twitch, OFF SCREEN Get in there!
Ken," Barbie, wait!"
Barbie, DON'T TOUCH ME! We’re through!
Ken, Barbie! I did…
Barbie, And give me my scarf back!
Ken, Ow!
Lotso, Lightyear! Explain our overnight accommodations.
Buzz," Sir, yes, sir! Prisoners sleep in their cells. Any prisoner caught outside their cell spends the night in the box. Roll call at dusk and dawn. Any prisoner misses roll call, spends the night in the box. Prisoners do not speak unless spoken to. Any prisoner talks back, spends the night…"
Jessie, In the box! We get it.
Lotso," At ease, soldier. They’re neutralized. But remember, they’ll say anything to make you doubt yourself."
Buzz," Don’t worry, Commander. Any doubt I had got pounded out of me at the academy."
Lotso," OFFSCREEN Listen up, folks. We got a way of doin’ things here at Sunnyside. If you start at the bottom, pay your dues, life here can be a dream come true! But if you break our rules, step outta line, try to check out early, well, you’re just hurtin’ yourselves."
Jessie, Woody! What did you to him?
Lotso, You all get a good night’s rest. You got a full day of playtime tomorrow. LAUGHING
Woody, 1225 Syca…
Woody, Who’s Velocistar237?
Trixie, Oh! That’s just a dinosaur toy down the street. That’s nothing. Let me just take care of that. Just a dinosaur.
Woody," All right. Sycamore. Okay, enter! Please don’t be far. Please, please! Right around the corner? It’s right around the corner!"
Trixie, Yay!
Woody," I’m going to college! Look at me! I’m a big toy on campus! Hello! Hey, I’ll see you at the sock hop."
Dolly," Okay, Potsie."
Woody," Hey, listen. If any of you guys ever get to Sunnyside Daycare, you tell ‘em Woody made it home."
Dolly, You came from Sunnyside?
Trixie, But how’d you escape?
Woody," Well, it wasn’t easy. What do you mean ""escape""?"
Mr. Pricklepants, Sunnyside is a place of ruin and despair. Ruled by an evil bear who smells of strawberries.
Woody, Lotso?
Buttercup," The guy may seem plush and huggable on the outside, but inside, he’s a monster."
Woody, But… How do you know that?
Mr. Pricklepants, Chuckles. He’ll tell you.
Chuckles," Yeah, I knew Lotso. He was a good toy. A friend. Me and him, we had the same kid, Daisy. I was there when Lotso got unwrapped. Daisy loved us all. But Lotso, Lotso was special. They did everything together. You’ve never seen a kid and a toy more in love. One day, we took a drive. Hit a rest stop. Had a little playtime. After lunch, Daisy fell asleep. She never came back. Lotso wouldn’t give up. It took forever, but we finally made it back to Daisy’s. But by then, it was too late. Something changed that day inside Lotso. Something snapped."
Lotso, She replaced us. Come on!
Chuckles," No, she only replaced you!"
Lotso, She replaced ALL OF US!! Didn’t she?
Big Baby, CRYING
Lotso, She don’t love you no more! Now come on!
Chuckles, We were lost. Cast off. Unloved. Unwanted. Then we found Sunnyside.
Chuckles, But Lotso wasn’t my friend anymore.
Chuckles, He wasn’t anyone’s friend. He took over Sunnyside and rigged the whole system.
Woody, So how’d you get out?
Chuckles," I got broke. Bonnie found me, took me home. Other toys, they weren’t so lucky. It ain’t right what Lotso done. New toys, they don’t stand a chance."
Woody, But my friends are in there.
Buttercup, You can’t go back.
Mr. Pricklepants, Returning now would be suicide!
Dolly, But what about your Andy?
Trixie, Isn’t he leaving for college?

Mrs. Potato Head, Wait! What’ve you done with my husband?
Lotso, Big Baby.
Mrs. Potato Head, OFFSCREEN Sweetheart!
Mr. Potato Head, GROANING It was cold and dark. Nothing but sand and a couple of Lincoln Logs.
Hamm," Uh, I don’t think those were Lincoln Logs."
Lotso, You all get ready. You got a play-date with destiny!
Woody," Uh, hello?"
Chatter Telephone," You shouldn’t have come back, cowboy. They’ve cracked down hard since you left. More guards, more patrols. You and your friends ain’t ever getting out of here now."
Woody, I made it ounce.
Chatter Telephone, You got lucky once. Want my advice? Keep your heads down. You’ll survive.
Woody," Yeah, for how long?"
Chatter Telephone, I’ve been here years. They’ll never break me. There’s only one way toys leave this place. Poor fella. Trash truck comes at dawn. Then it’s off to the dump.
Woody," Look, I appreciate your concern, old-timer. But we had a kid waiting for us. Now, we’re leaving. If you’d help us, one toy to another, I’d sure be grateful."
Chatter Telephone," SIGHING Well, if you’re gonna get out, first thing you gotta get through’s the doors. Locked, every night. Inside and out. Keys are left on a hook in the office."
Woody, OFFSCREEN Got it. What else?
Chatter Telephone," Lotso has trucks patrolling all night long. Hallway, lobby, playground."
Woody," OFFSCREEN Yeah, yeah, yeah. What about the wall?"
Chatter Telephone, Eight-feet high. Cinder block. No way through it. You go over and under.
Woody, That’s it. Doesn’t seem so bad?
Chatter Telephone, It’s not. Your real problem’s the monkey. The monkey’s the eye in the sky. He sees everything. Classrooms.
Chatter Telephone, Hallways.
Chatter Telephone, Even the playground.
Chatter Telephone," You can unlock doors, sneak past guards, climb the wall, but if you don’t take out that monkey, you ain’t going nowhere. You wanna get out of here? Get rid of that monkey!"

Slinky, He thinks he’s a real Space Ranger again.
Woody," Oh, no."
Hamm," OFFSCREEN Oh, yes. Return of the astro-nut."
Jessie," Oh, Woody we were wrong to leave Andy. I was wrong."
Mr. Potato Head," Jessie’s right, Woody. She was wrong."
Woody," No, no, it’s all my fault for leaving you guys. From now on, we stick together."
Slinky, But Andy’s leavin’ for college.
Jessie, College? Hog-tie the mailman! We gotta get you home before Andy leaves tomorrow!
Hamm, Tomorrow? But that means…
Woody," It means we’re busting out of here, tonight."

Mr. Potato Head," OFFSCREEN Yeah, and I would’ve got away with it, too, if it weren’t for you meddling toys! You ascot-wearing pink-noser! You’re not a toy! You’re an accessory! You’re a purse with legs."
Ken, Ow! Take him back to the box.
Mr. Potato Head," No! No, not the box! I’m sorry. I didn’t mean it! I like ascots. Really. No, no, no!"
