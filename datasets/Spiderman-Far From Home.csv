Maria Hill," Nick, this was a tragedy, but it's not why we're here. What, are we fighting the weather now?"
Nick Fury, Locals say the cyclone had a face.
Maria Hill," People say things when they're under stress. Okay, that does not mean that this is the start to another big world-"
Quentin Beck, Who are you?
Quentin Beck," You don't want any part of this. he steps forward, green blasts shooting from his hands"
Betty Brant, Gone. But not forgotten.
Jason Ionello, Thanks to Kenneth Lim and Vihaan Ramamurthy for their help with that touching video tribute.
Betty Brant, This year has been nothing short of-
Jason Ionello, a beep blocks out what he said S**t is crazy. It's like insane.
Betty Brant, Jason.
Jason Ionello, What?
Betty Brant, No swearing.
Jason Ionello," Yeah, it's like the last day of school, we're good."
Betty Brant," Historic. Over five years ago, half of all life in the universe, including our own Midtown High was wiped from existence. But then eight months ago, a band of brave heroes brought us back. They called it the Blip. Those of us who blipped away came back the same age. But our classmates that didn't blip grew five years older."
Jason Ionello," Yeah, like my little brother is now older than me."
Betty Brant," annoyed Yeah, it's math. And even though we had blipped away half way through the school year and had already taken midterms, the school made us start the whole year over from the beginning."
Jason Ionello, Totally unfair. It's not right.
Betty Brant," Tigers, it's been a long, dramatic, somewhat confusing road. As we draw this year to a close, it's time to move on to a new phase of our lives."
Jason Ionello," Pray nothing crazy happens again because, are the Avengers even a thing anymore? Does anyone even have a plan?!"
Peter Parker," I have a plan. enthusiastic Okay, first, I sit next to MJ on the flight."
Ned Leeds, Mhm.
Peter Parker," Second, I’m gonna buy a dual headphone adapter and watch movies with her the whole time."
Ned Leeds, Okay.
Peter Parker," Three, when we go to Venice, Venice is super famous for making stuff out of glass, right?"
Ned Leeds, True.
Peter Parker," So, I’m gonna buy her a Black Dahlia necklace, because her favorite flower is the Black Dahlia, because of, well..."
Ned Leeds, The murder.
Peter Parker," The murder. Four, when we go to Paris, I’m gonna take her to the top of the Eiffel Tower, give her the necklace..."
Ned Leeds, Oh!
Peter Parker," And then five, I’m gonna tell her how I feel...And then six, hopefully she tells me she feels the same way."
Ned Leeds, Oh! Don’t forget step seven.
Peter Parker, thinking Step seven...
Ned Leeds, Don’t do any of that.
Peter Parker, Why?
Ned Leeds," Because we’re gonna be bachelors in Europe, Peter!"
Peter Parker, Ned...
Ned Leeds,"  Look, I may not know much, but I do know this"
Peter Parker, ...Really?
Ned Leeds, And more than half of them are women!
Peter Parker," Okay, sure, but...I really like MJ, man. Okay? She’s awesome, she’s funny in a sort of dark way, and sometimes I catch her looking at me, and I like I’ve feel stood up way too...Wait. Dude, she’s coming now. Just don’t say anything."
MJ," What up, dorks? Excited about the science trip?"
Peter Parker," Hey, uh, yeah. We’re just talking about the trip."
Ned Leeds," Yeah, and Peter’s plan."
MJ, You have a plan?
Peter Parker, I don’t-I don't have a plan.
Ned Leeds," No, he’s just going to collect tiny spoons while we’re traveling to other countries. winks at Peter"
MJ, Like a grandmother?
Peter Parker, I’m not collecting tiny spoons. He’s collecting tiny spoons.
MJ," Oh. Okay, well...that was a real roller coaster."
Peter Parker, Mhm...
MJ," By the way, travel tip"
Peter Parker, Smart. Will do.
Ned Leeds," Dude, I think that went really great!"
Aunt May," When I blipped back to my apartment, the family living there was very confused. The wife thought that I was a mistress. the audience laughs The Grandma thought that I was a ghost. more laughter It was, laughs it was really a mess. Thank you all for coming out to support those who have been displaced by the Blip, and, of course, thanks to our very own Spider-Man!"
Spider-Man," Thank you, Ms. Parker, for having me. And thank you guys for having me. Awkwardly gives the audience a thumbs-up."
Aunt May," And thank you Spider-Man, and he’ll be right back out to take photos and videos, thank you!"
Peter Parker, That was amazing.
Aunt May, That was great. high-fives Peter
Peter Parker," Ah, that was so cool. I was a little nervous!"
Aunt May," My body was a little stiff, I felt like I wasn’t in the pocket."
Peter Parker," No, I thought you did great!"
Aunt May," Yeah, well, actually, I did think you were a little stiff."
Peter Parker," shrugs I felt that, too, I felt that, too."
Aunt May," It’s fine, it’s fine, it’s fine. Did you get your passport?"

Happy Hogan," It’s my Blip beard, because I grew it in the blip. Blip beard."

Aunt May, laughs Oh.
Happy Hogan," The very generous Pepper Potts, said..."
Aunt May, Thank you.

Peter Parker, Will do. turns to Happy as May leaves What just happened?
Happy Hogan," Heads up, Nick Fury's calling you."
Peter Parker, Nick Fury’s going to call me?
Happy Hogan, Yeah.
Peter Parker, Why?
Happy Hogan, Why? Because he probably has some hero stuff for you to do. You’re a superhero. He calls superheroes.
Peter Parker," Well, I mean if it was really that important, he’d probably call someone else. Not me."
Happy Hogan, Apparently not. Peter pulls out his phone from the bag No caller ID. That’s him.
Peter Parker, I don’t really want to talk to Nick Fury.
Happy Hogan, Answer the phone.
Peter Parker, Why?
Happy Hogan," Because if you don’t talk to him, then I have to talk, and I don’t want to talk to him."
Peter Parker, Why don’t you want to talk to him?
Happy Hogan," Because I’m scared . . . Just answer the phone. Peter holds up his phone, and declines the call You sent Nick Fury to voice mail?"

Peter Parker," Okay, one question at a time."
Woman, Are you the head Avenger? Are you the head Avenger now?
Peter Parker," Uh, no I'm not."
Woman," If the aliens come back, what are you gonna do?"
Peter Parker, Does anyone have any neighborhood questions?
Sean," Sean Wilford, Queens Tribune. What is it like to take over from Tony Stark? Those are some big shoes to fill."
Peter Parker," I'm uh-- I'm going to go. Thanks so much, everyone, for coming."
Peter Parker, Okay.
Aunt May, Hungry?
Aunt May, Oh... So sorry. Ha-ha. I thought you could sense that with your Peter-tingle.
Peter Parker, Please do not start calling it Peter-tingle.
Aunt May, So what's up? You can dodge bullets but not bananas?
Peter Parker," No, I just really need this vacation. I need a break."
Aunt May, You deserve it.
Aunt May," Yeah. Turns around You know what? You should pack your suit, just in case. I have a tingle about it."
Peter Parker," Please stop saying ""tingle,"" May."

Ned Leeds, Yeah!
Man 1, Can you help me get my stuff up?
Woman 1," Oh, sorry, that's mine."
Man 2, No worries.
Mr. Harrington, Do you want the first shift or the second? I could take either.
Mr. Dell, Give me the third shift. I took an Ambien.
Mr. Harrington, I can't chaperone these kids alone.
Flash Thompson," Yo, Parker! This, is called an airplane. It's like the buses you're used to, MJ walks by except it flies over the poor neighborhoods instead of driving through them."
MJ, Ma'am?
Flight Attendant, Mm-hm?
MJ," He blipped, so technically, he's 16, not 21."
Flight Attendant, I'll take that.
Flash Thompson, She's lying! I don't even know this girl.
Brad Davis," Classic MJ, right?"
Peter Parker, Did you know Brad was coming?
Ned Leeds," It-- It's so weird. Like, one day, he's that kid who cried and got nosebleeds all the time, and suddenly, we Blip back, and he's totally ripped and super nice and all these girls are after him."
Peter Parker, Not all the girls are after him.
Ned Leeds," No, man. They're all after him."
MJ giggling, Yeah. Here.
Ned Leeds," Anyway, on to more important things. He unzips his bag. He shows Peter Parker what he has. It's a nine-hour flight. We can play Beast Slayers the whole time."
Peter Parker, I need your help to sit next to MJ.
Ned Leeds, Seriously?
Peter Parker," Yes, seriously."
Ned Leeds, What about all our plan? American bachelors in Europe!
Peter Parker," That's your plan! That's a solo plan. Come on, this is my plan."
Peter Parker, Please.
Ned Leeds," Hey, guys. Uh, there's an old lady in front of us wearing a crazy amount of perfume and it's kind of setting off Peter's allergies. Uh, Betty, if you could switch seats with him, that would be--"
Betty Brant, He's allergic to perfume?
Ned Leeds," Yeah, yeah, because it-- it makes his eyes water, and he can't really--"
Mr. Harrington, Peter has a perfume allergy?
Ned Leeds," Oh, uh..."
Mr. Harrington," From experience, perfume allergies are no joke. I can feel hives breaking out already. MJ, stand up."
Mr. Harrington," Ned, take MJ's spot. MJ, you take my spot. Mr. Harrington turns toward Peter Peter, let's get you out of there."
MJ, Sorry.
Mr. Harrington," Zach and Sebastian, you take Ned and Peter's seats."
Brad Davis, That's all right.
Mr. Harrington," Ned, thanks for bringing this to my attention. Your safety is my responsibility and Mr. Dell's, but he's... Mr. Dell can be seen snoring I got it for now. Let's go, Peter!"
Mr. Harrington, Let's go!
Mr. Harrington," Yeah, I have a small bladder, so I took the aisle."
Ned Leeds, So did you want to play Beast Slayer?
Betty Brant, Nope.
Ned Leeds, Have you ever played any kind of PC game or--?
Betty Brant, No.
Ned Leeds, Nods Got it.
Mr. Harrington, Did I ever tell you how my wife pretended to Blip out?
Mr. Harrington," Turns out, she ran off with a guy in her hiking group. We had a fake funeral for her and everything. Well, the funeral was real because I thought she was really dead. Wanna see the video?"
Brad Davis," Well, I've gotta dual headphone adapter if you wanna watch a movie."
MJ," Only if it's depressing, or hilarious."
Mr. Harrington, To Peter Parker Oh you have a dual headphone adapter. We can watch together.
Pilot," Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen, this is your Captain speaking. Flight time today will be eight hours and forty-nine minutes to Venice, Italy."
Peter Parker," Hey, man. Did you see Brad and MJ on the plane? They were watching movies and laughing the entire time."
Ned Leeds," Dude, don’t worry, okay? I’m sure it’s nothing."
Betty Brant," Hey, babe, can you hold this for me, please?"
Ned Leeds," Yeah, of course"
Betty Brant, Thanks
Peter Parker, What was that?
Ned Leeds," Well, we actually got to talking on the plane, and it turns out we have a lot in common. So, uh, we’re boyfriend-girlfriend now."
Peter Parker, Whatever happened to being an American bachelor in Europe?
Ned Leeds," Peter... those were the words of a boy. That boy met a woman. A very strong and powerful woman. And now, that boy’s a man."
Betty Brant, Babe?
Ned Leeds," Coming, babe."
Peter Parker," There’s nothing in there, I swear"
Attendant," This, no. holds up banana"
Peter Parker, Sorry.
Peter Parker," I’m here! Mr. Harrington! I'm here, I'm here!"
Mr Harrington," Wait, wait, wait, Peter’s here. Thank goodness."
Mr. Harrington, Looks like we’re here. They're doing some renovations to the place. Getting some upgrades.
Student, This place is trash
Mr. Harrington, That must be the concierge.
Mr.  Harrington," Everyone, here we are! He takes in the desolate insides of the hotel — it’s just as bad as the outside, maybe even worse. A cat standing on a table meows. Mr. Harrington steps into a puddle of water"
Mr. Dell," Oh whoa... whoa, whoa."
MJ, Tell me we’re not staying here.
Flash Thompson, This place is sinking.
Mr Harrington, with feigned enthusiasm I think you mean charming!
Mr Dell, Okay everybody. Drop your bags off and we’re gonna meet at the Da Vinci museum at 3. Let's go!
Me Harrington, Vamanos!
MJ, It’s andiamo.
Mr Harrington, Andiamo!
Mr Dell to the students," When in Rome, you do as Romans do. When you’re in Venice, your socks get wet!"
Flash Thompson," What’s up, Flash Mob, how are you guys doing? I’m in Saint Marco Polo’s Someone — probably a student — runs past and hits Flash in the groin. Flash doubles over. — Oh!"
Betty Brant, This is so much fun!
Ned Leeds, Yeah? chuckles awkwardly
Student," Three, two, one, say ‘pizza!’"
Other students, Pizza!
Peter Parker, Buongiorno.
Shopkeeper, Buongiorno.
Peter Parker," Hi, Uh, I’m looking for a, uh..."
Shopkeeper, Fiore Nero he holds the black dahlia necklace up to the light
Peter Parker, It’s perfect.
MJ, Boh!
Peter Parker, What?
MJ," Boh. It’s the most perfect word in the world. Italians crated it, and I just discovered it."
Peter Parker, What does it mean?
MJ," That’s the thing, it can mean a million things. It can mean ‘I don’t know’, ‘get out of my face’, ‘I don’t know and get out of my face’. It’s the best thing Italy ever created, except for maybe espresso."
Peter Parker," Oh, so you’ve been drinking espresso."
Man, German? American?
MJ, Boh
Peter Parker, Whoa.
MJ," Boh is my new superpower. It’s like the anti aloha. I was born to say this word... So, what’s in the bag?"
Peter Parker," Oh, uh.... Boh."
MJ, Nice.
MJ," Whoa, cool."
Betty, What was that?
Peter Parker, Betty! You okay?
Peter Parker, Come on!
Betty Brant," Guys, we gotta go!"
Ned Leeds, What is that?
Peter Parker, I don’t know.
Ned Leeds, What’re you gonna do?
Peter Parker, I left my suit in the hotel room.
Ned Leeds, Why?
Peter Parker," Because I’m on vacation, Ned! Everyone’s gonna see my face, just get them outta here!"
Peter Parker, Get out of here. Go!
Peter Parker," Oh, my God!"
Peter Parker whispers, Come on.
Peter Parker," Oh no, you don’t!"
Peter Parker, You okay? Get out of here. Go!
Peter Parker, Excuse me sir! I c- I can help! Let me help! I’m really strong and I’m...sticky!
Mysterio, I need you to lead it away from the canals!
Mr. Dell, The DaVinci Museum. This is why we’re here in Venice.
Mr. Harrington," Oh, this is it. It’s closed."
Mr. Dell, What do you mean it’s closed? ‘Till when?
Student, November.
Mr. Dell, to Mr. Harrington You didn’t check the website?
Mr. Harrington," Oh, that’s a good idea."
Peter Parker," Oh, come on!"
Mr. Dell," leading a group of students Stay low, kids. We’ll be safe here."
Peter Parker, Groans
Student, Who is that guy?
Brad Davis," I don’t know, but he’s kicking that water’s ass!"
Ned Leeds, It’s aliens. It has to be.
Flash, Buzzfeed says there’s a sailor named Morris Bench who was exposed to an experimental underwater generator and got hydro powers
MJ," Yeah, you should definitely believe everything you read on the internet."
Flash, Spider-Man could take him
Mr Harrington, What do you think it is?
Mr. Dell," You Know, being a man of science.... witches"
Peter on his phone away from the cluster of students," No, no, no, no. We wanna stay. We wanna stay."
Aunt May at office back in New York," It’s a good thing I packed your suit, huh. I can’t believe you forgot it."
Peter, Yeah.
Aunt May," So, who was that guy you were with? Was that Mister Strange?"
Peter," Doctor Strange, May. Doctor Strange. And, ummm... No. I don’t know who that was. He was a new guy. I was trying to help him, but..."
Aunt May," Hey, Happy. No. That’s my lunch. Don’t eat that one."
Peter, Happy’s there?
Aunt May," Yeah. It’s Happy. He’s here. He came by to volunteer. And, he’s hanging around the office. And he wants to say hi."
Happy," No, I don’t...May forces the phone into his hand Hi, Peter"
Peter," Hey, Happy..."
Happy, I’m sorry. I’m working real hard here. I gotta do a leaflet drop.
Peter, What're you doing...
Happy, I’m glad you’re having a good time. Don’t worry. I’m really taking care of your aunt.
Aunt May," So, uhh, how’s the plan going?"
Peter," There’s... some setbacks, for sure."
Aunt May," Don’t ever think it, just trust your instincts and you’ll be fine."
Peter, I know. Love you. Bye.
Betty, Who is that guy?
Brad, He’s like Iron Man and Thor rolled into one.
Flash, scoffs He’s all right. He’s no Spider-Man.
MJ, What is it with you and Spider-Man?
Flash," What? He’s just awesome, okay? He protects the neighbourhood, and you know, he’s inspiring. He inspires me to be a better man."
Flash, toward Peter ’Sup dickwad? I thought you drowned.
Brad, Sounds like his name’s Mysterio.
MJ, L’uomo del misterio is Italian for man of mystery. They don’t actually know who he is.
Ned, Mysterio...
Betty and Ned, Cool name
Betty And Ned, Babe!
Peter," to MJ So, how much did you actually see?"
MJ, Not much... I was running.
Peter, Right. me too. I was also running...away.
Peter," So, Paris tomorrow. Go to the Eiffel Tower. Should be great."
MJ, I read it was secretly built as a mind control antenna to create an army of the insane.
Peter, oh...
MJ, Which is why it’s my favorite destination on the whole trip.
Ned, What are you gonna do about the water monster?
Peter," Nothing. it’s dead. And besides, that Mysterio guy’s all over it. Look... I just wanna spend some time with MJ. We were talking about Paris and... I think she really likes me."
Ned," That’s nice. Reminds me of when Betty and I first fell in love. I had just finished my first fruit cobbler, right-"
Nick Fury," You’re a very difficult person to contact, Spider-Man."
Peter, You’re Nick Fury. You just shot Ned.
Nick Fury," It’s just a mild tranquilliser. He’ll be all right. So good to finally meet you. I saw you at the funeral, but I didn’t think that was a good time to exchange numbers."
Peter," No, that would have been really inappropriate"
Nick Fury, That’s what I just said.
Peter, Right.
Nick Fury," The important thing is, you’re here. I tried to bring you here. You avoided me, and now, you’re here. What a coincidence."
Peter, Wait. Was this a coincidence?
Nick Fury," I used to know everything. Then, I come back five years later and now, I know nothing. No intel, no team, and a high school kid, is dodging my calls."
Nick Fury," Here’s what I do know... a week ago, a village in Mexico was wiped out by a cyclone. Witnesses say that cyclone had a face."
Nick Fury," Three days later, a similar event in Morocco. A village was-"
Mr. Harrington, Just making the rounds. See if anyone needs any emotional counseling after today’s traumatic event.
Peter," No. we‘re... we’re okay. We’re fine, thank you."
Mr. Harrington, Great. Cause I’m not qualified to actually...
Mr. Harrington," Oh, he’s passed out. I’m not really qualified to do it anyway, so... good night."
Peter," That was my teacher, sorry about that. You were saying?"
Nick Fury, A village was destroyed by what may well be another world threatening...
Betty, Babe? You still awake? You’re not answering any of my texts.
Peter," Um... he’s asleep, Betty."
Betty," Oh, already?"
Peter, Mh-hmm. Yeah.
Betty, Okay
Nick Fury, That’s why it’s imperative--
Mr. Dell," Hey, boys! That canal water today was filled with dangerous bacteria..."
Nick Fury," annoyed Another person touches that door, you and I are going to attend another funeral. Suit up."
"Mr. Dell in the backgrounds, still talking", ...let me know if either of you are vomiting--
Nick Fury, Stark left these for you. He hands Peter a small case
Peter, Really>
Nick Fury," ""Uneasy lies the head that wears the crown."" He looks at Peter Stark said you wouldn't get that because it's not a Star Wars reference. He scoffs"
Fury, to Peter You can lose the mask. Everyone here's seen you without it. You'd only be feigning anonymity and breathing through spandex for no good reason.
Fury, Come on.
Peter, quietly Yeah.
Fury, Over there we have Maria Hill. That is Dimitri.
Fury, And this is Mr. Beck.
Peter, Mysterio?
Quentin Beck, What?
Peter, Doesn't matter. It's just what my friends have been calling you.
Quentin Beck," Well, you can call me Quentin. He holds out his hand for Peter to shake"
Quentin Beck, You handled yourself well out there today. I saw what you did with the tower. We could use someone like you on my world.
Peter, softly Thanks. I'm sorry. Your world?
Fury, Mr. Beck is from Earth. Just not yours.
Beck," There are multiple realities, Peter. This is Earth, Dimension 616. I'm from Earth 833."
Peter," excitedly I'm sorry, you're saying there's a multiverse? 'Cause I thought that was just theoretical. That completely changes how we understand the initial singularity. We're talking about an internal inflation system and how does that even work with all the quantum--? It's insane--"
Peter, S-sorry. It's really cool. he turns back to Beck
Beck, Don't ever apologize for being the smartest one in the room.
Agent Hill, Anyway...
Beck, They were born in stable orbits within black holes. Creatures formed from the primary elements
Agent Hill, Versions of them exist across our mythologies.
Beck," Turns out, the myths are real."
Peter, Like Thor. Thor was a myth and now I study him in my physics class.
Fury, These myths are threats.
Beck," They first materialized on my earth many years ago. We mobilized and fought them, but with each battle they grew, got stronger. I was part of the last battalion left trying to stop them. All we did was delay the inevitable."
Agent Hill," The Elementals are here now, attacking the same coordinates. Our satellites confirm it."
Fury, So thank Mr. Beck for destroying the other three. There's only one left
Beck, The strongest of them all. The one that destroyed my Earth. It's the one that took my family.
Peter, I'm sorry.
Agent Hill, And it will be in Prague in approximately 48 hours.
Fury, We have one mission
Peter," I'm sorry. Did you say Prague? laughs nervously Mr. Fury, this all seems like bigtime, you know, huge superhero kinda stuff. And, I mean, I'm just a friendly neighborhood Spider-Man, sir."
Fury," Bitch, please. You've been to space."
Peter," I know, but that was an accident. Sir, come on. There's gotta be someone else you can use. What about Thor?"
Fury, Off-world.
Peter," Okay, um, Doctor Strange."
Agent Hill, Unavailable.
Peter, Captain Marvel.
Fury, Don't invoke her name.
Peter," Sir, look, I really wanna help, I do. But if my aunt finds out that I left my class trip, she's gonna kill me. And if I'm seen like this in Europe, after the Washington Monument, my whole class will figure out who I am and then-- and then the whole world will figure out who I am, then I'm done."
Fury, Okay. I understand.
Peter," I'm sorry, what?"
Fury," Why don't you get back before your teachers miss you and become suspicious. Dimitri. Take him back to hotel, please."
Peter," Thank you, Mr. Fury. And, uh, good luck."
Beck," See ya, kid."
Peter," Yeah, see you. to Agent Hill Bye, ma'am."
Agent Hill, Yeah.
Betty," talking to Ned Okay, drink lots of water and I'm gonna get you a vitamin C pill. You cannot get sick, okay?"
Ned, Okay. Thanks baby.
Peter," exiting hotel Hey, man. Are you sure you're good?"
Ned," Oh, dude, I'm fine."
Peter, Okay.
Ned," Seriously, getting tranq'd in the neck by Nick Fury, probably the coolest thing to ever happen to me anyway."
Peter, It is pretty awesome.
Ned, Yeah.
Peter, I'm just happy I don't have to go to Prague.
Ned, Seriously.
Mr. Harrison, exiting the hotel Good news! We're going to Prague! Huh!
Peter, What?
Students, Prague?
Mr. Harrison, Yeah. Tour company called. They upgraded us. You should've heard me on the phone with them. I really gave them hell. All I heard was crying.
Mr. Harrison, Look at our upgraded ride!
Ned," Peter, wha-- What's going on?"
Peter,  I think Nick Fury just hijacked our summer vacation.
Mr. Harrington," holding out his hand to Dimitri I'm uh, Mr. Harrington to the kids, uh... Dimitri doesn't respond Okay."
Ned, Awesome.
Peter, unenthusiastically Yeah. Awesome.
Flash Thompson," live-streaming on his phone Yo, what's up Flash Mob? It's your boy, the big F. Dimitri looks mildly annoyed Cruisin' through the Alps with my private driver, Dimitri."
Peter," reading aloud ""For the next Tony Stark, I trust you. P.S. say ""Edith"" -T.S."
EDITH, Stand by for retinal and biometric scan. a scan of Peter's face appears Retinal and biometric scan accepted.
Peter, Hello?
EDITH," Hello, Peter. I am EDITH, Tony Stark's augmented-reality security and defense system."
Peter," Huh. So, he made you for me?"
EDITH, No. But you have access to all of Tony's protocols.
Peter, Cool.
EDITH," would you like to see what I can do? EDITH stands for “Even dead, I’m the hero.” Tony loves his acronyms."
Peter," chuckles Yeah, he did."
EDITH, I have access to the entire Stark Global Security network including multiple defense satellites as well as back does to all major telecommunication networks.

Peter Parker, hopeful Really?
Quentin Beck," You guys do have sarcasm on this earth, right?"
Quentin Beck, How you feelin'?
Peter Parker," I didn't think I was gonna have to save the world this summer. I know that makes me sound like such a jerk. I just... I had this plan with this girl that I really like, and...now it's all ruined."
Quentin Beck," sympathetically You're not a jerk for wanting a normal life, kid. It's a hard path. You see things, you do things... Make choices. People look up to you... Even if you win a battle sometimes, they die. I like you, Peter. You're a good kid. There's a part of me that wants me to tell you, just... turn around, run away from all this. And then, there's another part of me that knows what we're about to fight. What's at stake. And I'm glad you're here."
Peter Parker," Me, too. worried tone But..."
Quentin Beck, friendly You're worried about your friends.
Peter Parker, Yeah. I just always feel like I'm putting them in danger.
Quentin Beck," Look, just... Get them inside and keep them in a safe place, for just a few hours. It'll be all right."

Tony Stark," Oh, $611,000,000 for my little therapeutic experiment."

Quentin Beck," Next, to William."
Obediah Stane," yelling, pointing at William Tony Stark was able to build this in a cave! With a box of scraps!"
Quentin Beck," The integration of my illusion tech, with your weaponized drones, was brilliant. Powerful illusions, real damage, worked like a charm. And it's just the beginning."
William Ginther Riva," proud Thank you, brother."
Quentin Beck, To Guterman.
Mysterio's Crew, To Guterman!
Quentin Beck," The story you created of a soldier from another earth named Quentin fighting space monsters in Europe, is totally ridiculous! And apparently exactly the kind of thing people will believe right now. I mean, everybody bought it."
Quentin Beck, To Victoria.
Mysterio's Crew, To Victoria!
Quentin Beck, Staging electromagnetic pulses at each attack sites with Fury's own satellites would confirm our lies? Inspired idea. To Janice!
Mysterio's Crew, Janice!

Janice, Thank you!
Man, among the cheers To Janice!
Quentin Beck," To the rest of you, Tony Stark is gone. There is a window of opportunity and someone will step up. But these days, you can be the smartest guy in the room, the most qualified, and no one cares. Unless you're flying around with a cape, or shooting lasers from your hands, no one will even listen. Well, I've got a cape. And lasers. cheers With our technology, and with EDITH, Mysterio will be the greatest hero on Earth. more cheers And everyone will listen. Not to a boozey man-child."

Quentin Beck vo, You took everything from me! This is for my family.
Quentin Beck, Pause. Pause?
William Ginther Riva, looking up Sorry.
Quentin Beck," Yeah, uh, can you just fast-forward to the end?"
William Ginther Riva, Yeah. Standby.
Quentin Beck," mumbling to himself Right. Fly, fly, fly... Zap, zap, zap... Pause."

William Ginther Riva, Weapons only. Standby.
William Ginther Riva, Nice.
Quentin Beck," Stop. Something... I don't know what it is. It's something... Just... You know what? Double the damage, and then run it again."
William Ginther Riva, You want me to double it up?
Quentin Beck, Yeah.
William Ginther Riva, Alright. Cover your ears.
Quentin Beck, Good. That's good.
Quentin Beck, We're on schedule?
William Ginther Riva," Oh, yeah. Uploading software hack to EDITH network, where drones will be able to create an event big enough to cover an entire city."
Quentin Beck," Right, well done. Make sure every drone is weapons hot. We need maximum damage."
Guterman, That's gonna cause a lot of casualties.
Quentin Beck," Oh, yeah. More casualties, more coverage. I gotta cut through the static. London is a beautiful city and it will suffer, but they can rebuild. If I'm gonna be the next Iron Man, I need to save the world from an Avengers-level threat. But, when its new savior descends..."
Quentin Beck vo, ...all those casualties will be forgotten.
Quentin Beck," Janice, you'll be in position with a quick change armor. For the victory lap."
Janice, Of course. Do you want to try...
Quentin Beck," No, no. That's..."
Quentin Beck, What's going on with my hand? Why is that happening?
William Ginther Riva," Oh, one of the drones that came back from the plaza was missing a projector. It's fine."
Quentin Beck," Wait, and you're... You're telling me this, now?"
William Ginther Riva," It's one drone. The image will be perfect, I promise."
Quentin Beck," That projector is evidence. It's going to tell people what we're doing and how we're doing it. I am trying, to fool seven billion people here, including Nick Fury, who happens to be the most paranoid and most dangerous person on the planet."
Quentin Beck," And if he catches on before I've killed him, then he will put a bullet in my head. And nobody wants a bullet in their head. Right?"
Quentin Beck, Right?!
Quentin Beck," William, can you look at me?"
Quentin Beck, Pull up EDITH.

Peter Parker, confused Where am I?
Dutch Football Hooligan #2, Municipal holding facility.
Dutch Football Hooligan #1, They said they found you unconscious at the train yard. Very dangerous.
Dutch Football Hooligan #3, We gave you the shirt because you seemed a bit cold.
Peter Parker, Thanks. You guys are nice. You speak really good English.
All Three, Welcome to the Netherlands.
Peter, I'm in the Netherlands right now?
Dutch Football Hooligan #1, Yup.
Peter Parker, calling out Guard?
Dutch Football Hooligan #1, The guard's on a break. Probably talking to his wife.
Dutch Football Hooligan #2, Yeah. She's pregnant.
Dutch Football Hooligan #3, in Dutch Oh ja? Wat leuk!

Peter Parker," Happy, is that you?"
Happy Hogan," Is it me? Yeah, of course, it's me!"
Peter Parker, Stop! Tell me something only you would know!
Happy Hogan," Something only I would know. Uh. You-I-uh, remember when we went to Germany? You pay-for-viewed a video in your room? They didn't list the titles, but I could tell by the price it was an adult film at the front desk. And you didn't know how I knew-"
Peter Parker," Okay! Okay! Fine, it's you, it's you, stop!"
Peter Parker, It's so good to see you.
Happy Hogan," Peter, you're going to have to tell me what the hell is going on here."
Happy hogan, Okay... hold still. Here we go.
Happy Hogan, I thought you had super strength.
Peter Parker, It still hurts.
Happy Hogan," All right, relax. Just a few more... there we go."
Happy Hogan, Relax!
Peter Parker," Don't tell me to relax, Happy! how can I relax when I've messed up so bad? I trusted Beck. Right? I thought he was my friend so I gave him the only thing that Mr. Stark left behind for me and now he's going to kill my friends and half of Europe, so please do not tell me to relax."
Peter Parker," I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I shouldn't shout. I just really miss him."
Happy Hogan," Yeah, I miss him too."
Peter Parker," Everywhere I go, I see his face. And the whole world is asking who is going to be the next Iron Man and... I don't know if that's me, Happy. I'm not Iron Man."
Happy Hogan," You're not Iron Man. You're never going to be Iron Man. Nobody can live up to Tony. Not even Tony. Tony was my best friend. And he was a mess. He second-guessed everything he did, he was all over the place. The one thing he did that he didn't second-guess was picking you. I don't think Tony would've done what he did... if he didn't know that you were going to be here after he was gone. Your friends are in trouble. You're all alone. The tech is missing. What are you gonna do about it?"
"Peter Parker, standing up", I'm gonna kick his ass.
Happy Hogan," No, I mean right now. Specifically, what are we gonna do? Because we've been hovering over a tulip field for the last fifteen minutes."
Peter Parker," Right, um... I can't call my friends because he's tracking their phones... uh, give me your phone?"
Happy Hogan," My, my cell phone?"
Peter Parker, Yeah.
Happy Hogan, Okay. Here.
Peter Parker, What's your password?
Happy Hogan, Password.
Peter Parker," No, what is your password?"
Happy Hogan," Password. The word. Spell it out, password."
Peter Parker, You're the head of security and your password is 'password'?
Happy Hogan," Yeah, I don't feel good about it either."
"Flash Thompson, over the phone"," Ello, governor! Cup of tea for you? I'mma be in London soon."
Peter Parker, They're in London.
Happy Hogan, London? Okay.
Peter Parker, Yeah. I need a suit!
Happy Hogan, Suit?
Peter Parker," Okay, um... bring up everything you have on Spider-Man."
Peter Parker," Yeah, open that. Okay. No, no, no..."
Peter Parker, What?
Happy Hogan," Nothing. You take care of the suit, I take care of the music."
"Peter Parker, tossing a wrench in the air"," Oh, I love Led Zeppelin! "
Peter Parker," Okay, can you pull up my web-shooters?"

Nick Fury, Where?
Maria Hill, London.
Mr. Harrington," Okay guys, the company set up a city tour, and then we'll grab a bite, then head to the airport."
Brad Davis, Is no one else gonna acknowledge how crazy this is?
Mr. Dell, I get it. There's been nothing scientific about this science tour at all.
Brad Davis," No, no, no. I'm talking about Peter. Has no one else here noticed how shady he is? Because I saw him in a bathroom of a rest stop with some woman, in his underwear..."
"Brad Davis, continuing"," ...and he's always sneaking away! Like back at the opera? Huh? And now what, he's suddenly off the trip? With his family in Berlin? Is no one else here interested in the truth?"
MJ," ""The very concept of objective truth is fading out of the world."""
Brad Davis," George Orwell. Thank you, MJ."
MJ," Yeah, well. I mean, since Peter's not here to tell his truth, what about you, Brad? Why do you think it's cool to take pictures of people in the bathroom?"
"Flash Thompson, clearly recording it"," Yeah, dude. What's that about?"
Brad Davis," No, no, it wasn't like that! It was... I was just trying to take..."
Mr. Harrington," Let's just put all this craziness behind us, and have a nice, peaceful afternoon. ""Sounds great, Mr. Harrington,"" said the class, okay..."
Mr. Dell," I'm gonna be the cool teacher right now... you've got to stop doing that, okay? It is weird. No more photos in the bathroom. Urinal or stalls. Okay?"
Mr. Harrington, Look at this!
Bus Driver, Mr. Harrington. Come on.
Mr. Harrington, We've got a bus all to ourselves!
Bus Driver, Nice to see you all. Come along.

William Ginther Riva," behind a computer Copy that, brother. Drones are entering the atmosphere, weapons hot."
Quentin Beck, Excellent. Janice?
Janice, Still working on the cape.
Quentin Beck, You gotta get those wrinkles out in a few hours. I could literally be shaking hands with the Queen. Guterman?
Guterman, Almost in position.
Quentin Beck," Okay, hit it, Victoria."
Victoria, Increasing pulse.
Maria Hill," Whatever this thing is, it's a hundred times bigger than the previous ones."
Quentin Beck, EDITH?
E.D.I.T.H.," Yes, Quentin."

Quentin Beck," losing it No, FIRE... ALL THE DRONES... NOOOOOOOOOW!"
Peter Parker, Beck! Beck... You lied to me. I trusted you.
Quentin Beck," I know. That's the most... disappointing part. You're a good person, Peter. Such a weakness..."
Quentin Beck, Stark was right. You do deserve that.
Peter Parker, You can't trick me anymore.

Voice, This is breaking news.
Pat Kiernan," We come to you now with revelations about last week's attack in London. An anonymous source provided this video, it shows Quentin Beck, aka, Mysterio, moments before his death. A warning, you may find this video disturbing."
Mysterio," I managed to send the Elemental back into the dimensional rift, but I don't think I'm gonna make it off this bridge alive. Spider-Man attacked me for some reason. He has an army of weaponized drones, Stark technology. He's saying he's the only one who's gonna be the new Iron Man, no one else."
E.D.I.T.H., Are you sure you want to commence the drone attack? There will be significant casualties.
Spider-Man, Do it. Execute them all.
'Pat Kiernan," This shocking video was released earlier today on the controversial news website, 'TheDailyBugle.net."
J. Jonah Jameson," There you have it, folks. Conclusive proof that Spider-Man was responsible for the brutal murder of Mysterio! An inter-dimensional warrior who gave his life to protect our planet, and who will no doubt go down in history as the greatest superhero of all time. But that's not all, folks. Here's the real blockbuster. Brace yourselves, you might wanna sit down."

Soren, Talos.
Talos," annoyed Come on, Soren, how was I supposed to know the whole thing was fake? I mean, that was all very, very convincing, you know. The performances, the illusion, that costume, the craftsmanship in that. I mean, this is just embarrassing for a shape-shifter. Fine!"
Talos," Hey there. I hope your mission is going well. We gave the glasses to Parker, about a week ago, like you said. And, uh, it was very touching, you know? Really, really quite touching."
Soren vo, Talos.
Talos," And, uh, you know, shortly after that, everything kind of went off the rails, and so we need you to come back. Because everyone kept asking me where the Avengers are, and I don’t know what to say to that."
Talos," So, you’re lucky…"
Nick Fury," claps his hands Everybody, back to work! Who's got my shoes?"
