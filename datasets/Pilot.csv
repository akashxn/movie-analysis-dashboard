JAKE," Dramatically This job is eating me alive. I can't breathe anymore. I spent all these years trying to be the good guy, the man in the white hat. I'm not becoming like them. I am them."
AMY," Hey! What are you doing, weirdo?"
JAKE," I'm doing the best speech from Donnie Brasco. Or actually, ten of me are doing the best speech from Donnie Brasco. He stares at the screens of himself. 'Sup?"
AMY," Get it together, man. Okay?"
AMY," So the store was hit about two hours ago. They took mostly tablets, laptops, and cameras."
JAKE, Sorry.
AMY," I'd like a list of all your employees, whoever had access to the store. I'd also like to apologize for my partner. His parents didn't give him enough attention."
JAKE," Uh, Detective... Amy looks to Jake slowly. I already solved the case. We're looking for three white males, one of whom has sleeve tats on both arms."
AMY, Walking over to Jake. And how do you know that?
JAKE," I had an informant on the inside. He's been here for years. Watching, learning. Waiting. His code name? He holds up a stuffed bear. Fuzzy Cuddle bear. He's a nanny cam. He flips the bear over to show the electronic device inside, which appears to be the end of a camera."
AMY, Scoffs You got lucky.
JAKE," No, I got here five minutes before you and figured that in this gigantic electronics store, there had to be at least one working camera. He plugs the camera into the TV screens, broadcasting the recorded video of two guys stealing. We see their face clearly. Oh! Hi, bad guys! He looks to the bear You did it, fuzzy. You busted 'em. It's time to come home."
JAKE," Imitating the Fuzzy while holding him up. I'm not sure if I can. I've been undercover so long, I've forgotten who I am. I have seen terrible things. I haven't known the touch of a woman in many moons."
AMY, Turning away. All right.
JAKE," Still imitating Fuzzy, however there is desperation in his voice. Detective Santiago! Don't walk away from me! Yes, I did crack the case."
JAKE," So, Santiago, would you do the honors?"
AMY, I hate this!
JAKE," Ah, yeah. And you're just gonna add one."
JAKE, I'm winning.
AMY, I hate this!
JAKE, It's a good feeling. It's a good feeling. Yeah.
AMY, Returning to her seat. Enjoy it while it lasts.
JAKE, I will!
TERRY," JP, update on the Morgenthau murder?"
CHARLES, I think it was flan.
JAKE, Charles thinks it was flan. I think it was butterscotch pudding.
ROSA, Maybe it was just old person gunk. You know how old people always have that gunk on them.
JAKE," Oldie gunk. Could be, yeah. Anyone else?"
TERRY, How about we focus on the murder and not the old person gunk?
AMY, Crime techs are at the scene now. We're heading back when they're done.
TERRY," Okay, I want you on this. It's gonna be priority one for the new C.O."
ROSA," Wait, tell us about the new Captain."
TERRY, Captain Holt will be here soon. He'll wanna introduce himself. Dismissed.
CHARLES," Hey, Gina. You know any scalpers? I wanna ask Rosa to go to the Rihanna concert with me, but it's sold out. The camera zones on Rosa at the end of the room, getting a paper out of the file box."
GINA," Okay, two points to make here. First, Rihanna... You... She looks disappointing. And then Rihanna. She flares her hands in the air to emphasize on the point."
CHARLES, Yeah. What's your second point?
GINA, She's got a type. Which is really anyone but you.
CHARLES," Yeah, that was my ex-wife's type too."
GINA," Look, a Rihanna concert's a pretty big swing, man. I don't know. She's into watching old movies."
CHARLES, Cool. Where would I find a place that shows old movies?
GINA," Oh, yeah, just go on the Internet and search for the phrase ""I want to buy two movie tickets for a girl who doesn't like me."""
CHARLES, Great. He stands up to leave. Thank you.
GINA, Good.
AMY," Hey, you heard anything about the new Captain?"
JAKE," Uh, no, and I don't care. I just wish Captain McGintley never left, he was the best."
AMY, He was terrible. You just liked him 'cause he let you do anything you wanted.
JAKE," On your marks, get set..."
MCGINTLEY, What the hell's going on around here?
JAKE, Fire extinguisher roller chair derby?
MCGINTLEY, Okay.
JAKE, And go!
JAKE, Yeah!
JAKE, What's your point?
AMY," If I'm ever gonna make Captain, I need a good mentor. I need my rabbi."
JAKE," Sorry, dude. But this new guy's gonna be another washed-up pencil pusher who's only concerned with He imitates a robot. Following every rule in the patrol guide. Meep morp zeep. Robot Captain Engage."
MAN, Is that what you think?
JAKE, He-hey! New Captain alert. He stands up. You must be the new C.O. I'm Detective Jake Peralta. Great to meet you.
HOLT, Now don't let me interrupt. You were describing what kind of person I'm gonna be. I'd like you to finish.
JAKE," That's not necessary. Holt stares at him, and Jake is sort of intimidated. Or I could recap very quickly, sure. Um, let's see. I think I said some joke about being a washed-up pencil pusher."
HOLT, Now do the robot voice.
JAKE, Which-
HOLT, The robot voice you were doing when you implied I'm a rule-following robot. I wanna hear it again.
JAKE," Softy, slowly and without any enthusiasm. Meep morp zarp. Robot."
HOLT, That's a terrible robot voice.
JAKE, Yep.
HOLT," The next time I see you, I'd like you to be wearing a necktie."
JAKE," Oh, actually, the last Captain didn't care if we wore ties."
HOLT," Stopping just before he enters his new office. Well, your new Captain does. And more importantly, he cares that you follow his direct orders. He then turns to the rest of the detectives and officers in the precinct. Everyone, I'm your new commanding officer, Captain Ray Holt."
AMY, Speech!
HOLT, That was my speech.
AMY, Short and sweet.
HOLT," Sergeant Jeffords, a word. He points to Terry."
TERRY," Yes, sir."
AMY, I love that guy.
JAKE, Same!
GINA, He's so suave. Does anyone get a little bit of a gay vibe? Everyone is quiet. No? Okay. She leaves too.
HOLT," Sergeant, you were in the 1-8 with me. Though you were significantly..."
TERRY," Fatter, sir. They called me ""Terry Titties."" Because I had large, uh..."
HOLT," Titties, yes. I remember. I never liked that nickname. Though to be fair, it was accurate. What's this I hear about you being on administrative leave?"
TERRY," A year ago, my wife and I had twin baby girls. He shows Holt his wallet with the photos of his kids. Cagney and Lacey."
HOLT, They have adorable chubby cheeks.
TERRY," Ever since, I kinda got scared of getting hurt. Lost my edge. There was an incident in a department store."
JAKE," Hey, man, you okay? You look a little jumpy."
TERRY, I'm fine. I'm fine.
JAKE, I think he's dead.
TERRY, And I'm still not right.
HOLT," Standing up and heading to his office window, looking over the precinct. Tell me about your Detective squad."
TERRY," Um... Well, Scully, Hitchcock, and Daniels. We see a group of three talking amongst themselves. Two of them are Norm Scully and Michael Hitchcock. The other is Daniels, however we do not ever see her again except for this scene. We still do not know if she is even alive. They're pretty much worthless, but they make good coffee."
HOLT, Copy that.
TERRY, Now the good ones. Rosa Diaz.
ROSA, Tell me who has me for Secret Santa.
HITCHCOCK, No! That takes all the fun out of it.
HITCHCOCK, It's Scully. He got you a scarf. I'll make him return it.
ROSA," Yes, you will."
TERRY, Charles Boyle.
TERRY," He's a grinder. Not the most brilliant Detective, but he works harder than anyone else. He's not physically... gifted."
CHARLES," Oh, man! My muffin. He goes to pick it up, but his head hits the counter instead. Ahh! Oh, my head! He looks to the muffin which he accidentally stepped on. My muffin, my head! And I stepped on the- On my muffin! And my head and my muffin."
TERRY, Amy Santiago.
TERRY," She's got seven brothers, so she's always trying to prove she's tough."
SCULLY, Careful. That stuff's pretty hot.
AMY," Oh, is it? Hmm? She puts more sauce on her sandwich, until the top is filled with sauce. She goes to eat it, some sauce dripping onto her hand. Her face starts to scrunch up, and she's gagging, spitting the food right out. Scully doesn't even bat an eye."
TERRY," She and Peralta have some big bet over who gets more arrests this year. Ever since the bet, their numbers have gone way up."
HOLT, Tell me about Peralta.
TERRY, Jacob Peralta is my best Detective. He likes putting away bad guys and he loves solving puzzles. The only puzzle he hasn't solved is how to grow up.
HOLT, That was very well put.
TERRY, I've talked a lot about Jake in my departmentally mandated therapy sessions.
HOLT," Look, you know my history. You know how important this is to me. This precinct is doing fine, but I wanna make it the best one in Brooklyn. And I need your help."
TERRY," Absolutely, sir. They shake hands. Where do we start?"
JAKE, Whispering and singing to his dancing. What is happening?
HOLT, We start with him.
JAKE," Okay, so the perp came in through the window, We see different camera angles of the crime scene itself, with remaining evidence scattered over the rooms. Left the muddy red footprint, and apparently had sex with the dish rack. We see a dish rack that has come out of the sink and is in ruin."
AMY," Shell casing found here. Two shots. Bang, bang. She gestured with fingers to where the gun would have shot Morgenthau, using them as guns."
JAKE," Great work, Detective. You get a tie. He threw one at her."
CHARLES," Hey, that's mine. You took it from my desk."
JAKE," That's right, Charles. Good solve. Tie for you. He gives him a tie."
CHARLES, Thanks!
JAKE, Now everyone be sure to put those on because it's impossible to solve crimes - unless you're wearing a tie.
AMY, Lay off the Captain. That man is gonna be my rabbi.
JAKE," Okay, first of all, when you use the word ""rabbi,"" you know that turns me on and that's unfair in the work environment. Secondly, your rabbi is a pain in my ass."
CHARLES," Yeah, he's a little too serious. What do you think, Rosa?"
ROSA, He seems cool.
CHARLES," Yeah, he seems cool. I agree."
ROSA," Looks like the perp stole a computer, a watch, and a Jamon Iberico ham, valued at what! $6,000."
JAKE," $6,000 for a ham?"
CHARLES," Jamon Iberico is an amazing cured ham from Spain. They had it at my uncle's funeral. I gorged myself at that funeral. I mean, I was constipated for three days."
JAKE," Wow, that's a great story, Charles, thank you. Charles laughs. All right, listen up, everybody. Better contact Captain Holt, let him know we got a ten-tie situation."
HOLT," Speaking of ties, where's yours, Meep Morp?"
JAKE, This is fantastic. He turns around. Captain! Hey! Welcome to the murder. What are you doing here?
HOLT, I like to know what my detectives are up to. That okay by you?
JAKE, Yep.
HOLT, Take Santiago and knock on doors. See if the neighbors heard anything.
JAKE, Door duty? It's a waste of time.
HOLT, Diaz and Boyle. Check in the coroner. Report back to me in an hour.
JAKE, That went well.
HOLT," From next door. No, it didn't."
JAKE, He's got like super hearing.
CHARLES," Hey, Rosa! Rosa. Rosa! She turns around. Um, I just happened to notice that there's an old movie festival playing at the film forum this week. Wanna go?"
ROSA, Sure.
CHARLES, Cool! Awesome. There's a bunch of movie options.
CHARLES, I'll probably just go with something classic like Citizen Kane.
ROSA, Citizen Kane is terrible. Pick a good movie.
CHARLES, Good call. Smart.
CHARLES, I'll do it. I'll pick a better movie than Citizen Kane.
HOLT, So Gina. Civilian administrators like yourself often have their ear to the ground. What do Santiago and Peralta have riding on this bet of theirs?
GINA," I will tell you on six conditions. Number one, you let me use your office to practice my dance moves. Second-"
HOLT, How about this? If you tell me-
GINA, Mm-hmm.
HOLT, I won't have you suspended without pay.
GINA," Oh, that sounds great. Holt sits down. Okay, the deal is if Amy gets more arrests, Jake has to give her his car. It's an old Mustang, and it's pretty sweet. If he gets more arrests, she has to go on a date with him. He guarantees it will end in sex. I bet on at least some over-the-clothes action. At the very least, some touching-"
HOLT," No, that's enough, Gina."
GINA, Caresses. I could see him showing up in a silk robe.
HOLT," That's enough, Gina."
GINA, All right.
HOLT, Thank you.
JAKE, Let the wasting of time begin.
