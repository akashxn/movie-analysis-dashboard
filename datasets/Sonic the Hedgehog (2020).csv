Sonic vo," So, I know what you're thinking... as the footage starts back up ""Why is that incredibly handsome hedgehog being chased by a madman with a mustache from the Civil War?"""
Sonic vo," Well, to be honest, it feels like I've been running my whole life. Is this too much? Am I going too fast? It's kind of what I do. You know what? Let's back up."
Sonic vo, This is the island where I'm from. It had everything
Sonic vo, Public access to loop-de-loops.
Sonic vo," And I never had to catch a school bus, because I could run across the entire island in less than two seconds."
Sonic vo," Also, there was no school. I know, pretty sweet island, right?"
Baby Sonic, flying high in the sky Yeah!
Sonic vo," I was born with extraordinary powers and was told to keep them secret. And like any kid, I did the exact opposite."
Sonic vo, That's Longclaw. She took care of me. She was basically Obi-Wan Kenobi… if Obi-Wan Kenobi had a beak and ate mice.
Longclaw, concerned Sonic! Someone could have seen you.
Baby Sonic, not worried No one saw me. running in place I'm too fast. And… holds out a sunflower I wanted to bring you this.
Longclaw, endeared Ah...
Longclaw, grabbing Sonic Get down!
Sonic vo, Turns out with great power comes great power-hungry bad guys. And I led them right to us.
Longclaw," Listen carefully, Sonic. You have a power unlike anything I have ever seen, and that means someone will always want it. The only way to stay safe is to stay hidden."
Longclaw, This world is on the far side of the universe. You should be safe there.
Baby Sonic, I don't wanna go without you.
Longclaw, You must. hands over the pouch These rings will be your most important possession.
Longclaw," If you're ever discovered, use one. pushing Sonic to the portal Never stop running. Now, go!"
Baby Sonic," scared, running back Longclaw!"

Tom," Come on, one car?"
Tom, I'm bored!
Wade vo, heard through the police radio Tom? Do you read me? Are you there?
Tom," sarcastically No, Wade. I'm actually on a yacht in Barbados. With Rihanna."
Wade," oblivious OMG... laughs That's amazing, please send pics."
Tom," No, Wade. I'm at the speed trap."
Wade vo, Already?!
Wade, How did you get back so fast? Barbados is in the ocean.

Tom," yelling at the turtle Hey, buddy! Where's the fire?! Got kids living around here. lifting his hand I thought it was kind of fun, sorry..."
Tom, confused What?
Wade vo," Tom, we need you down on Main Street. There's been a violent gang shootout."
Wade vo," laughing Just kidding, a duck stole a bagel. But they do need it back."
Sonic," to the turtle Whoa, buddy. You almost got yourself killed out there. softly tapping its head What are you, some kind of adrenaline junkie?"
Sonic," Must be rough, being slow all the time... smiling Tell you what, today is your lucky day."
Sonic," Woohoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! Have you ever felt so alive?! raises it in his left hand This is great, you're doing amazing!"
Sonic," Oh, geez!"

Sonic," Let's keep this our little secret, okay? You never saw me. waving his arms dramatically I was never here..."
Sonic vo," So, what were you expecting? A dirty little hedgehog, eating berries and struggling to survive? Think again, because I am living my best life on Earth."
Sonic vo, I've got a library...
Sonic vo, ...a home gym...
Sonic, Whoa!
Sonic vo, ...and a state-of-the-art security system.
Sonic, worried Oh no...
Sonic vo," And if I'm ever discovered, I'll follow Longclaw's instructions and use my rings to escape to a new planet."
Sonic vo," A nice safe little world, filled only with mushrooms."
Sonic vo," Gross, smelly mushrooms..."
Sonic, I hate mushrooms.
Sonic vo, But let's not worry about all that. This… is Green Hills.
Sonic vo," The greatest place on Earth. These are my people. And dare I say, I am their lovable space creature."
Sonic vo, So what if they don't know I exist?
Sonic vo," My favorite person is the Donut Lord. Protector of this town and defender of all creatures, big and small."
Tom," to the ducks Morning. Donald, Daisy, Daffy..."
Sonic vo," Donut Lord lives with Pretzel Lady. as she is doing yoga She is super nice to animals and, strangely, was born without bones."
Sonic, Ouch. Ouch. Ouch.
Sonic vo, There is one person in town who's actually on to me. He calls me the Blue Devil.
Crazy Carl, I almost caught him last night...
Sonic vo, Say hello to Crazy Carl.
Sonic vo, We have fun together.
Crazy Carl, dropping the flashlight I know you're out there! And I know you're real!
Sonic vo," in the distance No, I'm not!"
Sonic vo, Movie night is my favorite.

Sonic," Yes! Keanu, you are a national treasure."
Jack Traven," When I find you, I'll..."

You got me all wrong. back as the doctor And despite all these so-called friends of yours, takes off the glasses, normal voice deep down, sad you're still rather lonely?"

Tom," Uh-uh. Hey! No, no, no, no. gets out of the vehicle Get out of there, come on. Oh, come on! Get out of there! Get out of there, you trash pandas!"
Tom," Maddie? As Green Hills' most respected veterinarian, what is the fastest way to exterminate a raccoon?"
Tom," Hi, Ozzy. Hello! You could've seen… You don't eat garbage, do you?"
Tom, What's that? Is that what I think it is?
Maddie, Uh-huh. holds it out Open it.
Tom," Oh, it's kinda small. Is that bad?"
Maddie, Just... open it.
Tom," ""Dear Thomas, we have reviewed your application to the San Francisco Police Department and pending interdepartmental review and background check... we're happy to inform you that you've been selected to join our team."""

Tom," reading the text You never had a doubt, huh?"
Maddie, No! Mm-mmm.
Tom, I can't believe this.
Maddie," Oh, I know! You did it."
Tom," Hey, what are those?"
Maddie, Apartments for rent I found on Zillow. I thought Ozzy and I could fly there tomorrow and check out some neighborhoods.
Tom," I mean, this is all happening so fast..."
Maddie," playfully sarcastic Oh, man. It's the craziest thing. You apply for the job, you get the job."
Tom," Well, pending a background check."
Maddie," Oh, man. Hope they don't find out about that time you used the neighbor's WiFi..."
Tom, Correction
Tom," But Maddie, are you sure you're okay with this?"
Maddie," Thomas Michael Wachowski, what did you do the entire time I was in veterinary school?"
Tom, I worked a second job to pay the rent and a third…
Maddie," A third job to pay tuition. You sacrificed for me, I'm happy to sacrifice for you. Babe, are you sure you're okay with this? I mean, there's been a Wachowski protecting this town for more than fifty years. This is a big change."
Tom," I'm positive. It's time for this guy to get out there and prove himself. I love Green Hills, but... you know, I wanna help people in real trouble. I want someone to turn to me in a life-or-death situation and I'll be there for 'em."
Maddie, I get it. I'm so proud of you.
Tom, Thank you.
Tom," And so, it is with a heavy heart that I tell you all that I have accepted a position at the San Francisco Police Department, effective immediately. It's gonna be tough to leave my hometown and all my friendships, but this is something I feel like... I need to do. To grow, as both an officer... and a man."
Tom," What do you think, Sergeant Sprinkles? That wasn't so bad, right? Now all I gotta do is... tell everyone who isn't a donut."
Sonic," Whoa, the playoffs!"
Sonic, Oh! So cool...
Sonic," Bottom of the ninth tie score, and exactly who you want at the plate with the game on the line, Sonic!"
Sonic, But staring him down from the pitcher's mound is the most fearsome southpaw in Green Hills
Sonic," Okay. focus, Sonic… If you win this game, you'll be the most beloved kid in Green Hills."
Sonic," Hit it to the guy in left, he's a real space case."
Sonic, groans I can't with that guy.
Sonic," Hey, batter Sonic! Hey, batter Sonic! Suh-wing, batter Sonic!"
Sonic," I got it, I got it, I got it! dives, misses the ball I don't got it."
Sonic, as the coach Go home! Go home!
Sonic, as the catcher Come on!
Sonic, as the referee Safe!
Sonic," Ha, yes! Yes, yes, yes, yes! I did it! Did you see that? holding up his hand I did it! I did it..."
Sonic," I really am alone… All alone, forever."
Sonic," confused I'm sure no one noticed that giant blue explosion, right?"
Tom," Hey, Wade."
Wade," Hi, Tom. Wade here. chuckles nervously What is going on?"
Tom," pressing a nearby light switch Oh, gosh. I think the power is out."
Wade, You don't durr! The lights are out and the whole town is freaking out. W-What should I do?
Tom," Okay, relax. Take a deep breath. Call Gil, see if they can locate the downline. Then, call Zim and see if he can get his generator over to the Super Q, so the food stays… fresh..."
Wade vo, Call... Zim before Gil? Call Gil... Hello?
Tom, looking at his desk Call you back...
Wade," Wait, wait, hello? Was that the end of the instructions?"
Wade," Okay, alright… Uh, you can do this. What was the first thing he said to do? beat Right, relax."
Vice Chairman Walters," Twenty minutes ago, an energy surge knocked out power across the entire Pacific Northwest. What do we know?"
Navy Chief," Well, our first instinct was it was an EMP. But electromagnetic pulses don't have that kind of power."
Air Force Chief, NASA has ruled out meteor strikes or solar flares.
Homeland Security Secretary, The Department of Energy says it's not a power plant malfunction.
Vice Chairman Walters," Well, sounds like we're really good at figuring out what it wasn't."
Army Chief, This could be a prelude to a larger attack. I'm suggesting we scramble the Fifth and Sixth Regiment...
Vice Chairman Walters," No, no, no, no... This needs a much more sophisticated mind. Someone who understands technology."
Army Chief, You wanna send in a lab rat?
Vice Chairman Walters, Not just any lab rat. A lab rat with teeth.
Air Force Chief, You're not suggesting who I think you're suggesting?
Vice Chairman Walters," I know, he's a little weird..."
Air Force Chief, Weird?!
Army Chief," No, no."
Air Force Chief, He's a psychological tire fire!
Vice Chairman Walters," But he's also brilliant. Five PhD's, IQ off the charts and his... drone tech is-is-is-is revolutionary."
Army Chief, You're sure he can handle this?
Vice Chairman Walters, He has a Perfect Operations record. Remember the coup in Pakistan?
Army Chief, No.
Vice Chairman Walters, Or the uprising in Azerbaijanistan?
Navy Chief, That's not even a country.
Vice Chairman Walters, Exactly. And you can thank Robotnik for that.
Air Force Chief, I can't believe you're bringing that freak into this.
Vice Chairman Walters, Neither can I. But... we have no choice.
Female Soldier," Yes, Major..."
Major Bennington, What the...
Dr. Robotnik, Are you in charge here?
Major Bennington," Yes, I a..."
Dr. Robotnik, interrupting Nope!

Agent Stone, The Doctor thinks you're basic.
Dr. Robotnik, I'm initiating a sweep sequence.
Dr. Robotnik, Ten miles in every direction should suffice...
Dr. Robotnik," to Agent Stone, his back turned Is he still looking at me funny?"
Agent Stone," Yes, he is."
Dr. Robotnik," lifting his hand Tell him to stop, or I'll pull up his search history."
Agent Stone," If you don't stop looking at the Doctor, he'll take a closer look..."
Major Bennington, glaring at Robotnik I'm not deaf.
Dr. Robotnik," acting bored And tell him his men report to me now. Blah-blah-blah, blah-blah-blah, blah-blah-blah..."
Major Bennington," Excuse me?! Listen, pal. I don't know if you realize who..."
Dr. Robotnik," turning around Excuse me, Major... What was your name?"
Major Bennington, Benning...
Dr. Robotnik," interrupting him again Nobody cares! shaking his head, stepping closer Nobody cares… Listen, Major Nobody Cares, you know why nobody cares who you are? Because nobody cares about your feeble accomplishments. starts to circle him And nobody cares how proud your Mommy is that you're now reading at a third grade level. Have you finished Charlotte's Web yet? Spoiler alert"
Dr. Robotnik," Ah, my babies. Hoo! Look what came out of my egg sac! You know what I love about machines? turns around again, spreads his arms They do what they're told. They follow their program!

Agent Stone," I can feel it, Doctor."
Dr. Robotnik," inputting more commands It's evolution, Stone... making fists It's evolution!"
Dr. Robotnik, Agent Stone?
Agent Stone, Doctor?
Dr. Robotnik, Do you use anything useful in this image?
Agent Stone," Nothing at all, Doctor."
Dr. Robotnik, Of course you don't. Your eyes weren't expertly trained to spot tracks by the Native American shadow wolves.
Agent Stone, That's extraordinary...
Dr. Robotnik," No. What's extraordinary is... I determined the exact height, weight and spinal curvature of this creature. And my computer can't find a single match for it, anywhere, in Earth's Animal Kingdom. stands up, points at the screen This blackout was not a terrorist attack and that's no baby Bigfoot. gloating, stepping to his desk This guy… is something else… entirely. Divert all search units to the site of the footprint. That's one small step for men, one giant leap for me."
Sonic," Okay, okay. Everything is fine... You played some baseball, got a little upset, lightning shot out of your butt and now they're coming for you."
Sonic," Alright, alright, Earth isn't safe anymore. Time for Plan B"
Sonic," Okay, toothbrush, toothpaste, hair gel, night light, funny hat, this half-eaten cantiloupe… Oh, and my scented candle… My entire comic book collection.

Sonic, Oh no! They're right outside. I gotta go somewhere else...
Sonic," Goodbye, cave..."
Tom, Hey!
Maddie, Hey...
Tom, Whatcha doin'?
Maddie," Oh, just coloring with JoJo and Rachel."
Tom," Ah, that sounds... half fun. Hey, exciting stuff here. We had a power outage. The whole town went dark. It was like a sign, telling me to get out of dodge."
Maddie, Wade must have lost his mind.
Tom, Yeah. And he does not have much to lose. How's your sister? Did she convince you to leave me yet?
Maddie," No, but she did tell me to check your phone for dating apps."
Tom, The only apps on my phone are the ones that came with it. And the Olive Garden.
Maddie, Ah. Because when you're there...
Tom, You're family.
Tom," Oh, no way... The raccoons are back. walking to the cupboard And they are in for a surprise."
Maddie," Your surprise better not be my tranquilizer gun. They're just hungry. And also, that's for bears."
Tom, Good. Now I know it will work...
Maddie, Tom!
Tom," I'm kidding! I'm just gonna use it to scare 'em... softer Possibly to death. quickly Love you, honey. Bye!"
Maddie, To...
Rachel, spelling it out D-I-V-O-R-C-E.
Sonic," Okay, I'm in. With minimal damage to Donut Lord's property. picks up the ring again Here we go... Didn't work out on Earth, but that's okay. You're going to a safe world. A nice safe world filled with mushrooms. Mushrooms that'll be your only… friends. That sounds awful! I can't do this! You have to do it, there's no other option."
Sonic, Alright...
Tom, SFPD! Pending background check... Paws in the air!
Sonic," Uh, meow?"
Sonic, Ow!
Sonic, San... Francisco?
Sonic, as the portal closes and disappears No...
Tom, What?
Tom, lets out a breath The Blue Devil...
Sonic, Donut Lord?
Tom," You can talk. uneasy You're not… You're not here to abduct me, are you?"
Sonic, You abducted me.
Tom," Okay, that's a fair point. What are you? Why are you hiding out in my garage?"
Sonic," I-I needed somewhere safe, a-and you're the only person I could think of, Donut Lord."
Tom," Why do you keep calling me ""Donut Lord""?"
Sonic, 'Cause you talk to donuts. And then eat them if they get outta line.
Tom," Again, fair..."
Sonic," Wait, wait, wait… Where are the mushrooms? Why am I still on Earth? Oh, did… Oh, no! I lost my rings!"
Tom, What?!
Tom, What's happening? Is that your mothership? runs to the window Not in the mood to get probed.
Sonic, You think you're worried? I'm not even wearing pants.
Sonic, They're coming for me!
Tom, Who's coming for you? What's that gotta do with me?!
Sonic," I don't have time to explain, but you have to help me."
Tom," shaking his head No, I don't! Why?"
Sonic," Well, my legs, which normally would be classified as lethal weapons, feel like spaghetti. I need your help. Please? It's life or death."
Tom, Fine. Come with me.
Sonic," Uh, little help?"
Tom, All right. Stay here and be quiet.
Sonic," Good plan, great plan. We're already working so well together, practically finishing each other's sentences."
Sonic," Okay, bye."
Tom, Hello there! Can I help you?
Dr. Robotnik," lifts his hand Good morning, my rural chum. I'm… for the power company, investigating a blackout. walking up some stairs If you don't mind, I'd like to take a few readings inside your house."
Tom," No kidding, you're from the power company? when the doctor nods Oh, you must know my buddy Spencer, we play softball together."
Dr. Robotnik," Ah, Spence… He's a good man."
Tom," Yeah, yeah. Oh, come on in."
Dr. Robotnik, Great!
Tom," Take all the readings you need. Except, uh..."
Tom," The power companies usually take their readings from outside the house. That way, they can check 'em even when you're not home. Also, my buddy Spencer works for the gas company. He's more of an Ultimate Frisbee guy. So, you wanna tell me why you think I'm dumb enough to just let you walk inside my house?"
Dr. Robotnik," I'm sorry, Mr..."
Tom," Wachowski. But everyone calls me Tom. Except my dentist, he calls me Tim. But it's gone on for so long now that it would just be weird if I corrected him."
Dr. Robotnik," Well, Tom Whose Dentist Calls Him Tim, you may have noticed that this entire town has been experiencing a power outage."
Tom," Yep, no lights. Picked up on that."
Dr. Robotnik vo," Twenty minutes ago, I tracked an energy pulse with a similar signature to the one that caused this disruption."
Tom," Listen, uh, Mr..."
Dr. Robotnik, Doctor. Dr. Robotnik. But my dentist calls me Rob.
Tom," Hmm. Look, uh, Dr. Robot... skiz... Um… I'm sure what you're here for is very serious, but it's got nothing to do with me. You can ask anyone in town. Everyone knows me."
Dr. Robotonik, I bet they do. I'm sure you're hella popular with the Jeb and Merls and Billy Bobs in this glorified gas station rest stop.
Dr. Robotnik, Bet you go way back to the days of tipping cows and playing in a jugband!
Dr. Robotnik, stepping closer And maybe someday… you'll achieve your goal of getting a Costco card or adopting a Labradoodle. But the reality is... I surpassed everything you're ever going to do! Before I was a toddler. I was spitting out formulas while you were still spitting up formula.
Tom," I was breastfed, actually."
Dr. Robotnik," Nice. Rub that in my orphan face. Mr Wachowski, are you familiar with US Code 9-0-4, Title 10, Article 1-0-4?"
Tom," Yeah, I..."
Dr. Robotnik," interrupts Anyone… who attempts to aid an enemy of the United States shall suffer death. lifts his finger And if I'm the one that catches you, it'll be even worse."
Tom, Worse than death?
Sonic," Okay, I'm a ball. Just a normal ball. I'm blending in like a ball. Shh, stop talking. No, you stop talking. Be quiet, Sonic. You be quiet, Sonic! as the drones creep closer Oh, I hope they aren't scanning me with X-rays. I had kind of an embarrassing lunch."
Sonic," Don't freak out. Don't freak out, don't freak out. Don't freak out, don't freak out, don't freak out."
Sonic, I'm freaking out!
Sonic, Why don't you have your staircase carpeted?
Dr. Robotnik, And if I...
Tom, Old pipes.
Dr. Robotnik," Yeah, probably just the house settling. turns around Nothing to see here!"
Tom, Hey!
Dr. Robotnik, looking around Here's the thing. finger lifted I'm never wrong.
Tom," pats Robotnik's shoulder Well, first time for everything, I guess."
Tom, Would you like some cake? I hear raccoons have the cleanest mouths of any animal that routinely eats garbage.
Dr. Robotnik, Look at that… I was right. Note the lack of surprise. sternly Shall we try this again?
Dr. Robotnik, as he strokes the quill I'm going to give you five seconds to tell me where it is. Five...
Tom, I don't know what you're talking about.
Dr. Robotnik, Four...
Tom," Hey, tough guy. shows his badge I'm a cop. And you're threatening an officer."
Dr. Robotnik," How can you threaten somebody who never existed? Three... Come on, wrack your brain! You might be able to come up with some lame excuse to go on living, in two! One!"
Sonic, Wait! Don't hurt him!
Sonic, This feels excessive!
Tom, Stay behind me.
Sonic, Hi-yah!
Sonic, Don't worry! I've got it right where I want it! Hah! Yah! Can you believe Amazon is gonna deliver packages with these things?
Sonic, This was a horrible plan! What was I thinking?
Sonic, I'm gonna puke!
Tom, Come on! We gotta get outta here!
Sonic," over Tom's shoulder Aw, don't tell me that's all you got? I'm just getting started! Let me know if you wanna go round two with the blue!"
Agent Stone, Doctor? Are you okay? I saw a guy race outta here and I thought...
Dr. Robotnik, That you should stop them? Open your mouth… and say you thought that you should stop them.
Agent Stone," No, I thought that maybe I check to see if you were okay..."
Agent Stone, Hey!
Dr. Robotnik, You know what's hard about being the smartest person in the world?
Agent Stone, Everyone else being stupid.
Dr. Robotnik," in tandem Stupid! Yes, way to go! You got that one!"
Dr. Robotnik," Whatever this creature is, it's our job to secure it, neutralize it, uncover the source of its power. And if it resists… we take it apart... Piece by piece. puts his sunglasses back on See what makes it tick..."
Dr. Robotnik, Stone?
Agent Stone, Doctor?
Dr. Robotnik," Call Optical Illusions. Tell 'em I need new frames. throws them away They know what kind I like. Oh, and bring that quill."
Agent Stone," Yes, Doctor."
Tom," Alright, pal. You need to start talking, right now. Who are you? What are you?"
Sonic, frowns I'm a hedgehog. I feel like that's obvious. And I'm in big trouble.
Tom," Oh, you're in big trouble? You're not the one who punched some sort of government weirdo back there."
Sonic, You think you have problems?! I lost my rings!
Tom, Rings? What are you talking about?
Sonic," Okay, rings are how all advanced cultures travel between worlds, and now mine are on top of a pointy building I've only ever seen on your skintight T-shirt."
Sonic," So, I'd like you to take me to San Francisco, so I can get back my rings and use them to get to the mushroom planet."
Tom, Mushroom planet?
Sonic, Yes!
Tom, Right...
Tom," opens the door Okay, pal. Out you go."
Sonic," I'm sorry, what?"
Tom," Look, this is the worst possible time for me to get myself into trouble, okay? You asked me to save your life, I saved your life. Now, please… Go find your rings… and your mushroom land. Hopefully, I'm gonna wake up in a hospital bed and the doctor's gonna tell me that my colonoscopy was a big success. Okay? So, goodbye."
Sonic, Okay. Bye.
Tom, Goodbye.
Tom, ​​​​​​​Why aren't you leaving?
Sonic, I don't know where San Francisco is.
Tom, ​​​​​​​It's west.
Sonic, West?
Tom," ​​​​​​​Straight shot, can't miss it."
Sonic, Fine. That's cool. I'm totally cool saying goodbye now.
Sonic," So, as I crashed into the cold, dark water of the Pacific, I realized a few things. A"
Tom, nods I know.
Sonic, You shot me!
Tom, I-I heard you the first time. You don't have to... pile it on. Good grief...
Sonic," irritated I'm wet, I'm cold, there's a fish on my head, and clearly I'm not gonna be able to do this on my own."
Tom," All right, get in the truck."
Sonic, excited Really? You're gonna help me?
Tom, I guess it is a little bit my fault that all this is happening to you.
Sonic, Not a little bit. Entirely. It is entirely your fault.
Tom," nods Okay, it is entirely my fault. Are you coming?"
Sonic, Yes.
Sonic, Road trip! Woohoo!
Tom, shaking his head What am I doing?
Tom," All right, there's gonna be rules on this trip. Number one"
Sonic," Got it, Donut Lord."
Tom," Would you stop with the ""Donut Lord""? I have a name. It's Tom."
Sonic, I'm Sonic.
Tom," Sonic. Sonic… So, you've been spying on us all for years?"
Sonic," I mean, I wouldn't call it spying. We're all just hanging out, only I wasn't invited and no one knew I was there."
Tom, I can't believe Crazy Carl was right all this time.
Sonic," Yeah, you call him Super Observant Carl instead. looks outside Oh, my God! Stop the car, right now!"
Tom, What? What?! What?
Sonic," reading of a nearby sign ""The World's Largest Rubberband Ball""?! We gotta see it!"
Tom," No. No, no, this is not some fun family road trip, okay? The government wants to dissect you, and arrest me. This is serious."
Sonic," Eh, you're right. It was lame. Gift shop was cool, though."
Sonic, I got you a mouse pad. When are we gonna get there?
Tom, We will get there when we get there.
Tom," Alright. Now I gonna check in with Wade, see if he knows what's going on."
Sonic," You're gonna see Wade in that glass thing? What is it, a teleportation box?"
Tom," It's a payphone. It's mostly for drug dealers and fugitives from the law, which is us. Stay in the car, I don't want anybody seeing you."
Sonic, Oh... Fine.

Wade, Hello? Green Hills Police Department?
Tom," Wade, it's me."
Wade," Hi... I'm so glad that you called. Uh, some… some guys came in, asking me some questions. Uh, a little creepy. chuckles nervously Kind of reminded me of, uh, the guys from Men in Black, but not as, um, likable or, uh, charming as Will Smith."
Tom," Wade, what kind of questions?"
Wade," About terrorism. I told them that, like, I've gone ice fishing with Tom. H-He doesn't know how to make a bomb. He can't even make, like, bait in the cold."
Tom," Alright, Wade, listen to me. This is really important. Don't tell them that we talked, okay?"
Wade," You know, I think they already kn-know..."
Dr. Robotnik, Mr Wachowski?
Tom, Ugh… Tom.
Dr. Robotnik," I want you to know that the only other person who ever punched in the face was the school bully. He hit me in the cafetaria, causing a blunt force contusion to the soft tissue surrounding my orbital bone. Humiliated me in front of the entire school, and you know what I did in response?"
Tom," Uh, I'm assuming you reported him to the principal's office, 'cause, y'know, that kind of behavior is really unacceptable."
Dr. Robotnik," No. I examined the inefficiency of a world where brawn trumped brain, and I used technology to resolve that inefficiency. The boy ate his meals through a straw for a year, and I have never lost a fight again… Until today."
Tom," Hey, hooray for me then, huh?"
Dr. Robotnik," No, because you're about to become the bully. With the straw! I'm coming for you, Mr Wachowski. And when I catch you, I'll..."
Dr. Robotnik," Hello? Hello? Hello, hello, hello?"
Wade," I think he actually, um, hung up, because I noticed that the light isn't on."
Dr. Robotnik," Thank you, Officer Brainfart."
Wade," If you give me a second, I can get an outside line."
Dr. Robotnik, No... puts the phone back Don't be bothered. You just sit there and be you… seless.
Wade, No one's gonna… erase my memory here? yelling after them I will tell people about this!
Tom," Okay... Not exactly the healthiest meal, but..."
Tom, Sonic?
Tom," No, no, no, no, no, no!"
Sonic," tips his hat Howdy, partner!"
Tom," I'm not your partner. Come on, we're leaving."
Sonic, But there's a ZZ Top cover band. You gotta see their beards.
Tom," Weird enough to catch them some other time. Let's go, get up."
Sonic," If we stay, I promise I won't say another word for the rest of the trip, starting... now."
Roundhouse Waitress," Welcome to the Piston Pit. What can I get you, fellas?"
Sonic," Oh, I want nachos and Buffalo Wings... Oh, and guac. Funny word, isn't it? Guac, guac. Guac."
Roundhouse Waitress," to Tom Hey, no kids allowed in here. What's he got on, some kind of mask?"
Tom," Oh, he... Uh... He's actually forty-three years old and, um, suffers from a very rare skin disease, that stuns his growth and makes him look, um, like... like that."
Sonic," The face, I was born with. The confidence, I picked up along the way."
Tom," Make his a Mellow Yellow, please."
Roundhouse Waitress, Okay. walks away
Tom," takes off his hat, sits down You owe me one."
Sonic," But I never sat in a barstool before. So squishy! Oh, look at this! It spins!"
Sonic," Woah, woah, woah! laughs, stops spinning I feel sick."
Tom," Are you having fun? You're gonna check this of the old bucket list, huh? Big night for ya."
Sonic, What's a bucket list?
Tom," sighs A bucket list is, uh... It's a list of things you wanna do in your life before you, well, kick the bucket."
Sonic," I've never kicked a bucket either. Oh, I gotta make my list!"
Sonic," Ah-hah, hmm-hmm... Oh-ho-ho-ho, Sonic! Ah-hah, ah-hah..."
Tom, What? What's the matter?
Sonic," There's so much stuff I've never done. And now that I'm leaving Earth forever, I guess I miss my chance."
Tom," Well, I guess this is the kind of place you can get a lot of living done in a short period of time. I suppose we could spare an hour."
Sonic," What? You're gonna ""bucket list"" with me?"
Tom," Sure, why not?"
Sonic, You won't regret this.
Tom," nodding Oh, I'm pretty sure I will."
Sonic, Ha ha! New high score!
Sonic, Yippee-ki-yay! Ah-ha!
Sonic, Wait a second. Is this bull missing a head or does it have two butts?
Sonic, Oh-ho! This is easy!
Tom, Okay...
Sonic, laughing Yee-haw!
Sonic," Oh-ho-ho, I'm a cowboy, baby!"

Sonic, Ha ha ha!
Tom," Yeah, yeah. Laugh it up."

Tom, sarcastic laughter Glad you're having a good time.
Sonic, I am having a good time! I'm having the best time! What could go wrong?
Tom, Uh... lifting his hands Can we help you?
Roundhouse Thug, We don't like your kind around here.
Sonic, Our kind? What kind is that?
Roundhouse Thug, leaning forward Hipsters.
Sonic, stunned How dare you?
Tom," Oh, hey, you know what? We were just leaving anyway, weren't we? There's not, not a problem."
Sonic," No, no, no! It's okay."
Tom," No, no, no, we're leaving."
Sonic, I know exactly how to handle this situation.
Sonic," Pop quiz, hot shot. You just picked a fight with a poorly disguised hedgehog who's seen way too many action movies. What do you do? What do you do?"
Sonic, Ha!
Sonic," Huh. looking at the bottle Am I crazy? It's supposed to break, right?"
Sonic," uneasy Dink. Dink, dink. Break, please. Break, please. Break this bottle, please. Please, please, please, please, please..."
Tom," Uh, Sonic?"
Sonic, Uh-oh!
Sonic, excited Oh-ho-ho-ho-ho!

Sonic," Why, you..."
Sonic, Ha ha ha! blowing on his fists
Sonic, Uh-oh.
Sonic, Really?
Sonic, pulling the napkin away Olé!
Sonic," So, should we get outta here?"
Tom," Yeah, time to go."
Sonic," Oh-ho-ho-ho-ho! That was amazing! Oh, wait a second. Did we even pay our tip? It doesn't matter! Oh, watch this, watch this! I always wanna do this."
Male Patron, Get 'em!
Sonic," See ya, suckers!"
Sonic," I can't say for sure, but I think they liked me."
Sonic, Yes!
Tom, Yeah!
Sonic, Yes!
Tom, touching his cheek Ouch...
Sonic, They got you pretty good.
Tom, I'm all right. I've been hit harder.
Sonic, Did you see how much toilet paper I used?
Sonic, The next person that goes into that bathroom will have nothing to wipe with.
Sonic," The floors were sticky, the crowd was rough and the odds were against us, but there was no stopping Donut Lord and the Blue Blur! speeds onto the other bed Scratch another one of my list!"
Tom, You are a weird little dude.
Tom, Okay...
Sonic," So, what are we gonna do now?"
Tom, I'm gonna pass out watching TV. You should too.
Sonic, But this is my last night on Earth. I wanna soak up every last second.
Tom," Alright, well, anything you can find to do in this room, you knock yourself out."
Sonic, Good times.
Tom," Oh, come on. That's awful, what did you eat?"
Sonic, I think it's called a chili dog.
Tom," lying down You might wanna check your fur on that one, buddy."
Tom," Hey, so, what's this next planet you're supposed to go to like?"
Sonic," It's no Earth, I can tell you that. There's no people, just breathable air and giant mushrooms and stuff."
Tom," Well, look at it this way. At least, you won't be the only fungi."
Sonic, No. Don't ever do that again.
Tom, chuckles I liked it.
Sonic," looking around, sad I'm really gonna miss this place. I know I have to leave Earth to be safe, but what if Longclaw was wrong? Maybe I could have a life here..."
Tom, Alright… You should get some sleep.
Sonic," You sleep. Don't worry about me. I'm gonna stay up all night, enjoying Earth while I can."
Tom," Sure, kid. As long as we're on the road by eight."
Reporter," ...Tom Wachowski, accused of committing an act of domestic terrorism. Wachowski is considered armed and dangerous. Any information regarding his whereabouts should be reported to the local authorities immediately."
Agent Stone, holding up a photo of Tom Did he say where he was going?
Roundhouse Thug," Maybe, maybe not. handing it back Like I'd ever tell you."
Dr. Robotnik," Stand down, Agent Stone. This well-meaning citizen obviously doesn't understand the urgency of the matter."
Roundhouse Thug, Really?
Dr. Robotnik," Now, that's what I call ""good cop, bad cop""."
Dr. Robotnik, Hoy!
Dr. Robotnik, Left yourself open.
Dr. Robotnik," Judging by the quickest route to San Francisco, the approximate speed of their vehicle, local weather conditions... pushes buttons They should be... right about... here."
Agent Stone," That's brilliant, sir."
Dr. Robotnik, Thanks. under his breath For nothing...
Sonic," So, what's on your bucket list?"
Tom, Me?
Sonic," Yeah. Everyone has a bucket list, right?"
Tom," Well, sure, but... I mean, you're the one leaving Earth and… I'm not planning on dying anytime soon."
Sonic," Oh-ho-ho, don't be so sure. Your best friend is a magnet for danger."
Tom," Oh, already appointing yourself as the bestie."
Sonic, Mm-hmm.
Tom," Little presumptuous, but... I mean… What? No, I-I like you, of course, but... y'know, we're not best friends."
Sonic, You tucked me in last night.
Sonic," Fine, fine, fine. Best animal friends."
Tom, That would be my dog Ozzy.
Sonic," Okay, let's just drop this increasingly humiliating topic of conversation. Bucket list, give it to me!"
Tom," Okay, there is one thing. In Green Hills, I've always felt... I don't know, more like a babysitter than a real cop, y'know? So, I want a chance to prove myself, under real pressure. I'm gonna move to San Francisco, become a street cop. And… I don't know, see if I have what it takes."
Tom, What? Wh-Why is your face doing that?
Sonic, You're leaving Green Hills?!
Tom, Okay...
Sonic, B-B-But why? Why would you leave Green Hills?
Tom," This may be hard for you to understand, but Green Hills is a small town. It's a very small town."
Sonic," Uh, it's not small. There are hundreds of people."
Tom," That's a small town, dude."
Sonic, It's a perfect town and the people need you!
Tom," Please, I clean out their gutters, I jump-start their cars in the winter. They could call anybody to do that."
Sonic," Sure, they can call anybody, but they don't. They call you."
Dr. Robotnik," Hmm… Eeny, meeny, miny… mayhem!"
Sonic, standing on his seat You're not making any sense!
Tom, Would you calm down?
Sonic," You come from a great town with great people and, by my count, zero bad guys trying to kill you!"
Sonic," Besides, what could possibly be more important than protecting the people you care about?"
Tom," Look, I-I get..."
Dr. Robotnik, raising his fist Yeah!
Sonic," You know what?! I was wrong about you! You're not the Donut Lord at all! You're more, like, the Jerk Lord!"
Tom, Have you noticed the harpoon stuck in our dash?!
Tom, Sonic!
Sonic," overrun with emotions, charging up I was forced from my home! Your home is perfect and you're leaving it! Why would you do that?!"
Tom, Your body!
Sonic," Oh no, no, no, no! Not again!"
Tom, Hey! Hold on!

Daughter, You just had one!
Son, It's mine!
Dad," Hey, stop fighting or I'm taking that thing away!"
Daughter," Yeah, right, Dad..."
Tom, Where you going?
Sonic," Just drive the car. I'll take care of this. climbing onto the edge And if I don't make it, just ditch me. You seem good at that."
Sonic," Hey, everyone! Welcome back to my livestream! Today, we're destroying robots! Step one..."
Sonic," Yes, we did it!"
Sonic, We did not do it. Who is this guy?
Dr. Robotnik, Ever wonder where your tax dollars are going?
Tom, My turn!

Tom," No, beeping is bad! Get rid of it!"
Sonic, I'm trying!
Tom, Just throw it out the win... Throw it anywhere!
Sonic, I can't get it off!
Tom," Alright, I'm pulling over!"
Sonic, Did I get it?

Dr. Robotnik, Can we have a moment?
Dr. Robotnik, to Stone Pin yourself to the wall.
Dr. Robotnik," Do you know why I won't miss you when you're gone? Human beings are unreliable and stupid, and I care very little about them! But my machines are diligent, relentless... They're everything to me!"
Dr. Robotnik, Hmm?

Rachel," Uh-uh! Aliens? Maddie, your husband's lost his mind. Can use this as an opportunity to leave him. No one would judge you!"
JoJo, So you won't hurt your feet anymore.
Sonic, Really?

Sonic, lightly lifting his head Guac… I like that word...
Dr. Robotnik, unaware of Tom I don't have to tell you how many scientific breakthroughs have been made possible by animal testing. You're being very selfish.

Tom," I'm the Donut Lord, you son of a..."
Dr. Robotnik," Auto pilot, adjust."

Maddie, Really?
Tom," to Sonic I kind of feel like I checked the ""Save A Life"" box of my bucket list. to Maddie Now all I wanna do is spend my life with the people I care about. I wanna check that box."
Maddie, Okay. I'd like that.
Wade," Alright, everybody. Nothing to see here. Disperse. Just an ordinary day in Green Hills. Carl, I'll take that chainsaw."
Wade vo," Come on, let's go! You act like you've never seen a fight between an intergalactic space rodent and a robot with a doctorate."

Tom," Oh hey, I guess we can close the file on that Robotnik guy, huh? He... just disappeared."
Vice Chairman Walters," I'm sorry, but, uh... no such person exists, or ever has existed."
Tom, to Maddie I wish that were true...
Vice Chairman Walters," You haven't, by any chance, been in contact with a certain… alien creature since the incident, have you? Uncle Sam would love to have a chat with him. Very casual. Brunch, perhaps."
Tom," Oh, you mean the little blue guy?"
