Homer," Huh? Oh, I love you, Marge."
Marge," Oh, you tell me that all the time."
Homer," Good, because I do love you. I don't deserve you as much as a guy with a fat wallet and a credit card that won't set off that horrible beeping."

Homer, Thirteen bucks? You can't get anything for thirteen bucks.
Barney," All right, thirteen big ones! Springfield Downs, here I come!"
Homer, What?
Barney," You heard me, I'm going to the dog track. I got a hot little puppy in the fourth race. Want to come?"
Homer," Sorry Barney, I may be a total wash out of a father but I'm not going to take my kid to a sleazy dog track on Christmas Eve."
Barney," Come on Simpson, the dogs name is Whirlwind. Ten to one shot. Money in the bank."
Homer, Uh-uh.
Bart," Aw, come on Dad. This could be the miracle that saves the Simpsons' Christmas. If TV has taught me anything, its that miracles always happen to poor kids at Christmas. It happened to Tiny Tim, it happened to Charlie Brown, it happened to the Smurfs, and it going to happen to us."
Homer," Well, okay lets go. walking off Who's Tiny Tim?"
Elf #1," Hey, Moley, do you think Santa will be able to find Elf County under all this snow?"

Selma, Where's your husband?
Patty," Yeah, its getting late."

Son," Can we open our presents now, Dad?"
Father," You know the tradition, son, not till the eighth race."
Homer," Hey Barney, which one is Whirlwind?"
Barney, Number six. That's our lucky dog right over there. He won he last five races.
Homer," What, that scrawny little bag of bones?"
Bart," Come on Dad, they're all scrawny little bags of bones."
Homer," Yeah, you're right. I guess Whirlwind is our only hope for a Merry Christmas."
Announcer," Attention racing fans, we have a late scratch in the fourth race. Number eight Sir Galahad will be replaced by Santa's Little Helper once again Sir Galahad has been replaced by Santa's Little Helper."
Homer, Bart did you here that? What a name - Santa's Little Helper. It's a sign. It's an omen.
Bart," It's a coincidence, Dad."
Homer, at the betting desk What are the odds on Santa's Little Helper?
Man,' Ninety nine to one.
Homer, Wow! Ninety nine times thirteen equals... Merry Christmas!
Bart, I got a bad feeling about this.
Homer, Don't you believe in me son?
Bart, Uh...
Homer," Come on boy, sometimes your face is all that keep me going."
Bart," Oh... go for it, Dad."
Homer, That's my boy! to the clerk Everything on Santa's little Helper.
Elves,' Hip-hip-hooray! Hip-hip-hooray! Hip-hip-hooray!
Lisa, Yay!
Grampa, Unadulterated pap.
Patty, It's almost nine o'clock.
Selma, Where is Homer anyway?
Patty, It's typical of the big doofus to spoil it all.
Lisa, What Aunt Patty?
Patty," Oh nothing, dear. I'm just trashing your father."
Lisa," Well, I wish that you wouldn't. Because aside from the fact that he has the same frailties as all human beings, he's the only father I have. Therefore, he is my model of manhood, and my estimation of him will govern the prospects of my adult relationships. So I hope you beer in mind that any knock at him is a knock at me, and I am far to young to cartoon myself against such onslaughts."
Patty," Mmm-hmm. Go watch your cartoon show, dear."
Homer," Come on Bart, kiss the ticket for good luck. Not that we need it!"
Announcer," Here comes Shirley the mechanical rabbit. And they're off. Around the first turn, it's Whirlwind in the lead, and coming up on the left is Quadruped followed by Dog of War and Fido."
Announcer, Dog of War coming up fast on the outside. And in last place... is Santa's Little Helper.
Homer, D'oh! Oh...
Bart, Don't worry Dad. Maybe this is just for suspense before the miracle happens.
Homer, Come on you stupid dog.
Bart, Come on boy.
Announcer, Whirlwind wins by a country mile followed by Dog of War.
Homer, D'oh!
Bart," It doesn't seem possible, but I guess TV has betrayed me."
Homer," I don't want leave till I dog finishes. long pause Ah forget it, lets go."
Homer, Find any winners son?
Bart," Sorry, Dad."
Barney," Hey Simpson, what did I tell you - Whirlwind. Lets go Daria."
Man,"' Beat it! Scram, get lost! You came in last for the last time!"
Bart," Look Dad, its Santa's Little Helper."
Man,' And don't come back!
Homer," Oh no you don't! No, no, get away from me! Uh-uh."
Bart," Oh, can we keep him dad please."
Homer, But he's a loser! He's pathetic! He's... the dog licks Homer ... a Simpson.
Marge, Mmm... maybe we should call the police.
Patty, He'll sober up.
Selma," Yeah, come staggering home."
Patty, Uh-huh. Smelling like cheap perfume.
Marge, Homer!
Grampa, waking up What? Wha?
Homer," Look everybody, I have a confession to make."
Patty, This should be good.
Homer," I didn't get my Christmas bonus. I tried to not let it ruin Christmas for everybody, but no matter what I did..."
Bart," Hey everybody, look what we got!"
Lisa, A dog! All right dad!
Marge, God bless him.
Lisa, So love at first sight is possible.
Bart, And if he runs away he'll be easy to catch.
Marge," This is the best gift of all, Homer."
Homer, It is?
Marge," Yes, something to share our love. And frighten prowlers."
Lisa, What's he's name?
Homer," Number 8. I mean, Santa's Little Helper."
All," Rudolph the Red nosed reindeer, had a very shiny nose, and if you ever saw it, you would even say it glows."
Bart, Like a light bulb!
Homer, Bart!
All," All of the other reindeer, used to laugh and call him names."
Lisa, Like Schnozzola!
Homer, Lisa!
All," They never let poor Rudolph, join in any reindeer games."
Bart, Like strip poker!
Homer, I'm warning you two!
All," Then one foggy Christmas Eve, Santa came to say..."
Marge," Take it, Homer."
Homer," Er... Rudolph, get your nose over here, so you can guide my sleigh... today..."
Grampa," Oh, Homer..."
All," Then all the reindeer loved him, and they shouted out with glee, Rudolph the red nosed reindeer, you'll go down in history!"
Bart, Like Attila the Hu- ught urk!
Homer, You little... grrrr!!
